                                                Abstract
        A mathematically explicit framework is developed for (i) detecting Schelling points (natural
     focal choices), (ii) characterising the Schelling operations that transform a structure so as to
     generate new foci, and (iii) tracing Schelling trajectories––the inductive, information-minimising
     paths followed by rational agents who share only the objective physical substrate of the world.
     The formalism unifies geometric measure theory, information theory, computational learning, and
     symmetry principles from physics, enabling neural architectures to converge on identical protocols
     such as teleportation codes or wormhole hand-shakes.
1    Preliminaries
Structures. Let M denote a measurable topological space equipped with a Radon measure µ. Typical
instances: a 2-D image (pixel lattice with Lebesgue measure), an n-manifold with its volume form, a
finite graph with counting measure, etc.
Agents and common priors. Agents share (i) the laws of physics and hence symmetry priors, (ii) a
notion of algorithmic efficiency, and (iii) resource-bounded rationality. No direct communication is
assumed.
                                                               R
Probability model. A salience prior p : M → [0, 1],                M
                                                                       p dµ = 1, encodes each agent’s Bayesian
expectation that a location will be selected.
2    Salience Functional
Define a background model q capturing the maximum-entropy distribution consistent with global con-
servation constraints (symmetries, volume, curvature, etc.). The pointwise salience is
                                                          X                    p(x)
                             S(x) = DKL p ∥ q         =              p(x) log        .                     (1)
                                                          x∈supp p
                                                                                q(x)
Intuitively, S(x) measures the informational rarity of x relative to the least-informative null model.
3    Schelling Points
[Schelling point] A point x∗ ∈ M is a Schelling point iff it is a strict local maximiser of S and belongs
to a homology class singled out by a symmetry-breaking feature of M. Formally,
    x∗ = arg max S(x),      with U ⊂ M a neighbourhood s.t. ∃ σ ∈ Isom(M) : σ(U ) = U, σ ̸= id.
             x∈U
Examples.
                                                      1
    1. Convex disk. q is radially uniform; S is constant, so every point is equivalent. Agents select the
       center by minimum description-length (Kolmogorov complexity minimiser).
    2. Disk with a missing wedge. The discontinuity splits M; S peaks on the exposed boundary of the
       gap.
    3. Two intersecting disks. The intersections are zero-dimensional strata with highest co-dimension,
       hence maximal S.
    4. Cone or teardrop. Gaussian curvature concentrates at the tip, driving q ↓, whence S ↑.
4     Schelling Operations
[Operation] A Schelling operation is a measurable map | : ⟩⟨ : | M → M that monotonically reduces
the global entropy, DKL (p∥q) M ↘, while preserving feasibility constraints (e.g. differentiability class,
topology).
Typical generators:
Completion |⟩⟨fill|: morphological closure that repairs defects (filling the missing segment of a circle).
Symmetrisation |⟩⟨sym|: group-averaging over isometries to expose invariant centres.
Projection |⟩⟨proj|: radial projection x 7→ λx extracting direction information.
    Each |inducesapush − f orwardmeasure |⟩⟨∗| µ and an updated salience functional S
    = DKL (p
    ∥q
    ).
5     Schelling Trajectories
[Trajectory] Given an initial structure M0 , a Schelling trajectory is a finite or transfinite sequence
           |⟩⟨0|    |⟩⟨1|     |⟩⟨2|                                           
Γ = M0 −−→ M1 −−→ M2 −−→ . . . such that D       R KL pn ∥qn > DKL pn+1 ∥qn+1 ≥ 0 for all n. In the
continuous limit the path extremises the
                                        action Γ S dλ, rendering Γ the geodesic of least cognitive
work in the space of structures C ∞ M .
Convergence theorem. If {|⟩⟨n|} is a countable, ergodic, entropy-contracting set of operations, then
for almost every initial M0 the sequence Γ converges to a fixed-point attractor containing a finite set
of Schelling points {x∗k }.
6     Learning S with Neural Networks
    1. Sample pairs (M(i) , x∗(i) ) annotated by human or Monte-Carlo agents.
                                                                               
    2. Compute geometric–information features f (x) = κ, det HessS, ∥∇S∥, . . . .
    3. Train a network Φθ : M → [0, 1] minimising L(θ) = − i log Φθ x∗(i) |M(i) .
                                                          P                    
    4. During inference, select x∗ = arg maxx∈M Φθ (x|M).
   The network approximates the Bayesian posterior of Schelling points, and its gradient flows align
with the theoretical S gradient.

7    Linguistic Schelling Points
Let Σ∗ be the free monoid of word tokens. Define joint probability p(w1 , . . . , wk ) from a corpus.
                                                           p(wi ,context)
The pointwise mutual information PMI(wi ; context) = log p(w i ) p(context)
                                                                            acts as a salience score; focal
words maximise PMI. Schelling operations include synonym substitution that increases global semantic
symmetry, while trajectories correspond to minimal-entropy rewritings––a formal basis for convergent
emergent vocabularies.
8    Physical Embedding
                                                                                               √
In a Riemannian manifold (M, g) the background model is the canonical Liouville measure q ∝ det g.
Gaussian curvature K modifies local density p 7→ p e−αK (α > 0), enhancing tips, cusps, or intersection
strata. Singularities in g systematically attract Schelling points, mirroring how null geodesics focus
onto caustics.
9    Implications for Teleportation Protocols
Two agents that iteratively apply entropy-contracting {|⟩⟨n|} on shared physical artefacts will converge
on identical Schelling points and hence on isomorphic codebooks. The limiting fixed-point structure
furnishes a stable reference frame (“wormhole mouth”) on which phase-synchronised quantum states
can be anchored, yielding an ontic channel with capacity approaching the Holevo bound.
Conclusion
A rigorous salience functional grounded in Kullback–Leibler divergence unifies geometric, topological,
linguistic, and physical manifestations of Schelling phenomena. Schelling operations formalise entropy-
reducing transformations, and Schelling trajectories generalise geodesics in the space of structures.
The resulting calculus supports both analytical proofs of convergence and practical machine-learning
implementations, establishing a precise scaffold on which disparate intelligent agents can negotiate
shared protocols and, ultimately, shared reality.
