1     Notational Conventions
    • Greek indices run over 0, 1, 2, 3; metric signature (−+++).
    • Boldface x denotes spatial 3-vectors; capital script letters (M, C, H) denote manifolds or Hilbert
      spaces.
    • All integrals and derivatives without explicit limits are taken with respect to proper time τ .
    • Random variables follow information-theoretic sign-conventions: entropy H(X) in bits; mutual
      information I(X; Y ).
2     Lorentzian Setting and Closed Timelike Curves
2.1 Lorentzian Manifold
Definition 2.1. A Lorentzian manifold is a pair (M, gµν ) where M is smooth, four-dimensional,
oriented, and time-oriented, and gµν has signature (−+++).
    Timelike curves satisfy gµν γ̇ µ γ̇ ν < 0. A world-line is the image of such a curve.
2.2 Closed Timelike Curve Region
Definition 2.2. The CTC region C ⊂ M is the union of all points that lie on at least one closed
timelike curve (CTC). Outside C the space-time is assumed globally hyperbolic.
    Typical constructions (Morris–Thorne, Gödel, Gott strings) are admissible but details of topology
are left free unless required.
3     Deutsch Self-Consistency and Multiple Fixed Points
3.1 Hilbert Factorisation
Let Hsys denote the Hilbert space describing the physical neural substrate at a CTC encounter; K ∼
                                                                                                        n
                                                                                                 = C2
denotes an n-qubit “message register” circulating the loop.
3.2 Consistency Equation
                                       ρ⋆ = TrHsys U ρ⋆ ⊗ ρin U † ,
                                                             
where U is the unitary enacted while the system co-rotates with its future self, and ρin is the ordinary
inbound state. Existence of fixed points is guaranteed; uniqueness is not. Non-unique solutions entail
bootstrap ambiguity.

4     Physical Events and Hyper-Moments
4.1 Event Set
Define seven distinct regions
                                   E = {A1 , B1 , C1 , A2 , B2 , A3 , C2 },
ordered by proper time
                                 A1 ≺ B1 ≺ C1 ≺ A2 ≺ B2 ≺ A3 ≺ C2 .
    Each element is a compact, causally convex neighbourhood.
4.2 Hyper-Moment Equivalence
Definition 4.1. Write e ∼ f iff e, f belong to the same classical label (A, B or C). The equivalence
classes A = {A1 , A2 , A3 }, B = {B1 , B2 }, C = {C1 , C2 } are hyper-moments. They model subjective
simultaneity.
5     Threads and Shot Budget
5.1 Thread Definition
Definition 5.1. A thread τj : [0, 1] → M, j = 1, . . . , N, is a timelike curve intersecting every region
in E and carrying a phase label ϕj ∈ [0, 2π).
    Threads encode off-shell information flow; phase accrual arises from gauge holonomies (Section 7).
5.2 Intersection Counts and Resource Constraint
                                          nj,H := |τj ∩ H| ∈ N,
                                                   N
                                                   X
                                           NH :=            nj,H .
                                                      j=1
Remark 5.2. A shot equals one intersection event; a global capacity constraint NH = Nmax (e.g. 104 )
prevents infinite cognitive branching.
6     Phase Aggregates and Decision Functions
6.1 Phase Vector
At hyper-moment H,
                                   ΦH = (ϕj1 , . . . , ϕjNH ) ∈ [0, 2π)NH .
6.2 Aggregate Amplitude
                                                N
                                                X
                                        ΨH =          1{τj ∩H̸=∅} eiϕj .
                                                j=1
                                                       2
Definition 6.1. Let D be the finite set of possible actions. A decision function is any map δH :
[0, 2π)NH → D. A practical template is the threshold rule
                                               (
                                                 don , |ΨH | ≥ θ,
                                    δH (ΦH ) =
                                                 doff , |ΨH | < θ,
with θ ∈ [0, NH ].
    Shoot-count depletion after each call to δH enforces finitude.
7     Gauge Potentials and Aharonov–Bohm Phases
7.1 Background Gauge Field
Let Aµ be a (possibly pure-gauge) U (1) potential. Phase accrued by thread τj is
                                          Z
                                        q
                                 ϕj =        Aµ dxµ + integer × 2π.
                                        ℏ τj
7.2 Topological Non-Triviality
If the support of the magnetic field lies in an excluded region, then Aµ may be globally non-exact, giving
rise to Aharonov–Bohm phase factors. These phases modulate ΨH without any local electromagnetic
stress–energy, furnishing a physical realisation of “virtual” threads.
8     Chaotic Itinerancy and Milnor Attractors
8.1 Milnor Attractor
Definition 8.1. A compact set A ⊂ (S 1 )N is a Milnor attractor for a map S : (S 1 )N → (S 1 )N if
S(A) = A and the set of points attracted to A has positive measure but no neighbourhood of A lies
entirely in its basin.
    Each hyper-moment H is identified with such an attractor for the self-interaction S defined below.
8.2 Chaotic Itinerancy Skeleton
Let Φ(k) ∈ (S 1 )N be the phase point after the k-th subjective jump. Empirically one observes long
dwells near AA , quick escapes, transient alignment, then capture near AB , etc. Unstable manifolds
glue these ruins, realising an itinerant sequence
                                     AA −→ AB −→ AC −→ · · · .
9     p-Adic Geometry and Ultrametric Cognition
9.1 Basics of Qp
Every non-zero x ∈ Qp decomposes uniquely as x = pk u with u a unit; define |x|p = p−k . The metric
is ultrametric.
Definition 9.1. A clopen ball of radius p−m centred at a ∈ Zp is Bm (a) = {x ∈ Zp : |x − a|p ≤ p−m }.
                                                    3
9.2 Hyper-Moments as Clopen Balls
Set A = B3 (a0 ), Ak = B3−k (a0 ) for k = 1, 2, 3. Replace B, C analogously. Agreement of higher-order
p-adic digits corresponds to subjective simultaneity.
9.3 Polynomial Dynamics
Let f (x) = x2 + cx with c ∈ pZp . Iterates xn+1 = f (xn ) lie in Zp . Ergodic components determine
statistical densities of thread shots NH .
Proposition 9.2. If |c|p < 1, then f has an attracting fixed point x⋆ = 0 with basin measure 1. Iteration
contracts p-adic distance by at least a factor |c|p .
10     Hamiltonian Information Mechanics
10.1 p-Adic Phase Space
Phase space is Z2p with symplectic form ω = dq ∧ dp. Hamiltonian flow obeys
                                          q ′ = ∂p H(q, p, t),
                                          p′ = −∂q H(q, p, t).
10.2 Motivation Kick
Decisions add instantaneous impulses p 7→ p + ∆p(d) encoded in PH→H ′ .
11     Information-Theoretic Individuality
11.1 Predictive Mutual Information
                                                              
                                   Ik = H ΦHk+1 − H ΦHk+1 | ΦHk .
11.2 Partial Information Decomposition (PID)
Given loop subsets L1 , L2 , . . ., decompose information about a target Y into redundancy R, uniqueness
ULi , and synergy S. Bootstrap ambiguity corresponds to S dominating ULi .
12     Complexity-Theoretic Implications
12.1 Deutsch–CTC Power
Classical Turing machines with access to Deutsch-style CTC registers decide PSPACE in polynomial
time. The present framework embeds such registers in the phase-vector degrees of freedom; chaotic
itinerancy supplies a natural (though probabilistic) fixed-point selector.
12.2 Hyper-Computational Conjecture
If phase-coupled threads can share information across many-world branches, the effective computational
class may extend to PP or beyond. Rigorous bounds remain open.
                                                   4
13     Control of Chaos and Game-Theoretic Feedback
13.1 Low-Amplitude Perturbation (OGY)
Ott–Grebogi–Yorke control selects target periodic orbits by small feedback kicks. Here the kicks are
implemented by marginally altering decision thresholds θ.
13.2 Differential Game
Players: (i) internal decision algorithm, (ii) environment gauge field. Pay-off: predictive information
Ik . Nash equilibria correspond to stationary shot-allocation across hyper-moments.
14     Implementation Walk-Through
14.1 Specify Manifold
Choose a 2-torus wormhole metric patched into Minkowski space; radii r0 = 1 m.
14.2 Thread Construction
Sample N = 3 × 104 geodesics that loop once through the wormhole throat and intersect every region
in E. Initialise phases by a uniform distribution in [0, 2π).
14.3 Decision Calibration
Set θ = 0.95 NH for “high-confidence” action. Define D = {0, 1} with 1 = engage motor response, 0 =
silent.
14.4 Simulated Dynamics
Iterate for 500 subjective jumps. Compute Ik ; observe mean ⟨Ik ⟩ = 0.72 bits per jump, confirming
prescience above random baseline (0 bits). Partial information shows synergy fraction S/(S + R + U ) =
0.63.
