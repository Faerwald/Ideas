Local Computation and Hypercomputational Epistemology
0. Prelude: Dual Senses of “Local”
In general relativity(Einstein’s theory relating gravity to spacetime curvature)a statement is “local”
if it refers to an infinitesimal neighbourhood of a spacetime point in which the metric(tensor field
measuring distances and causal structure) can be flattened to Minkowski (flat-spacetime) form. In
computational complexity(the branch of CS classifying problems by resource usage) a constraint is
“local” if it depends on only finitely many bits whose indices lie within a bounded neighbourhood
in some discrete (space, time) grid. The former is differential–geometric(using calculus on manifolds);
the latter is combinatorial (based on discrete structures). The Cook–Levin theorem(proof of SAT being
NP-complete) exploits the second notion. Super-recursive paradigms propose that epistemic truth
depends on only such local verifications, mirroring how curvature in GR is recovered by stitching
together local frames.
1. Local Checkability in the Cook–Levin Theorem
The Cook–Levin construction shows that the global correctness of a Turing-machine(idealised tape-based
computer model) computation can be enforced by local constraints only. One encodes the entire com-
putation history into a CNF formula(conjunction of disjunctions of literals)
                                                     m
                                                     ^
                                                Φ=         Ci (. . .),
                                                     i=1
where each clause(disjunction of at most k literals, here k = 3) inspects at most a fixed number of
variables (e.g. three literals in 3SAT (3-variable satisfiability problem)). Specifically:
   • Clauses enforce adjacency between tape cells at the same time step;
   • Clauses enforce transition consistency for the same cell across consecutive time steps.
Thus, to decide satisfiability(existence of an assignment making all clauses true) of Φ one need only
verify each small clause. This is the sense in which
                                   Computation is locally checkable.
Formal Equivalence.
                   Φ is satisfiable ⇐⇒ ∃ assignment satisfying every local clause Ci .
1.1 Detailed Tableau Encoding
Let M = (Q, Γ, b, δ, q0 , qacc , qrej ) be a deterministic single-tape Turing machine where Q(finite set of
states), Γ(tape alphabet), b(blank symbol), δ(transition function), q0 (start state), and qacc , qrej (accept/reject
states). For an input of length n and time bound T = poly(n)(polynomial in n) one constructs a
(T + 1)×(T + n + 1) tableau(space–time grid of configurations) whose entries are symbols in Γ ∪ Q.
Each row represents the tape at a time step; each column tracks a fixed tape cell through time. Every
clause in Φ enforces one of three types of nearest-neighbour (involving only adjacent cells) constraints:
  (i) Initialization (t = 0);
 (ii) Horizontal consistency (t fixed, x 7→ x±1);
(iii) Vertical consistency (x fixed, t 7→ t±1).
Because each clause mentions at most three symbols (the centre of a 2×2 window in the tableau), Φ has
O(T 2 )(quadratic) number of clauses. Mapping (M, x) 7→ Φ is computed in time poly(|x|)(polynomial
reduction).
                                                       1
1.2 Graph–Theoretic View
Define a graph G(set of vertices with edges) whose vertices are tableau cells (t, x) and whose edges
connect cells occurring together in some clause. Every clause then corresponds to a constant-size induced
subgraph(vertex set with all connecting edges). Satisfying Φ equals finding a labelling(assignment of
symbols) ℓ : V (G) → Γ ∪ Q respecting every subgraph pattern.
1.3 Connection to Constraint Satisfaction Problems
The reduction converts TM-HALT(halting decision problem) into a bounded-width CSP (constraint
network with limited scope). Thus Cook–Levin anticipates modern notions such as local consis-
tency(propagation of partial solutions), constraint propagation(iterative pruning), and bounded-treewidth(graph
decomposition controlling complexity) tractability.
2. Epistemic Inversion and Hypercomputational Truth
In classical (Turing) computation, valid outputs must be generated (produced by a finite, halting se-
quence) by a halting process. Hypercomputational and super-recursive(extending beyond Turing limits)
paradigms reverse this requirement:
      “A result need not be generated by a recursive procedure— it only needs to be locally
      verifiable by one.”
   This shift—from generation to verification(polynomial-time checking)—constitutes an epistemic in-
version(reversal of knowledge criterion).
2.1 Relation to NP, Popper, and Gödel
   • NP(nondeterministic-polynomial class): The search space is vast, but any witness(candidate
     solution) is locally checkable in polynomial time.
   • Popperian falsifiability(philosophy where scientific claims must be testable) emphasises testa-
     bility, not derivational history.
   • Gödelian witness-checking(short proofs of arithmetic statements) extracts a short certificate
     verified efficiently, independent of discovery.
                                Truth = Survival under Local Verification
2.2 Limit-Computability and Stabilization
Limit-computable(output stabilises though never halts) models (inductive Turing machines, limit ma-
chines, trial-and-error machines) may produce outputs via oscillatory, non-halting, or probabilistically
divergent processes, yet if the output stabilizes(no further changes after some finite index) it is accepted.
2.3 Catalogue of Hypercomputational Models
Inductive Turing Machine           Produces a sequence a0 , a1 , . . . and stabilizes on the correct answer
    after finite time.
Limit Machine        Computes a limit limt→∞ at that exists even though the machine never halts.
Trial-and-Error Machine Outputs alternating conjectures and refutations until a conjecture re-
     mains unrefuted forever.
                                                     2
Oracle Machine        Accesses a non-computable set A(external decision source); verification is dele-
    gated to A.
   All share the axiom: verification is cheaper than generation.
2.4 Complexity-Theoretic Framing
Let LV(Local-Verifier class) be the set of languages decidable by a verifier operating on bounded-width
windows. Classic NP is the closure of LV under polynomially bounded proof lengths. Hypercomputa-
tional proposals enlarge the proof domain to include non-recursive strings while keeping the verifier
class fixed.
3. Axiom of Hypercognitive Truth
      A string S ∈ {0, 1}∗ is epistemically valid if there exists a polynomial-time verifier (algorithm
      that checks a proof)
                                     V : {0, 1}∗ −→ {TRUE, FALSE}
      such that
                                              V (S) = TRUE,
      regardless of the generative process for S.
3.1 Corollaries
(C1) Limit Principle — If a process outputs St at step t and limt→∞ St = S, then S is epistemically
     valid provided V (S) = TRUE.
(C2) Probabilistic Cognition — A stochastic generator whose output distribution assigns non-zero
     probability to some S with V (S) = TRUE can, in the limit, yield epistemically valid knowledge
     with probability > 0.
(C3) Inverse Law of Effort — Epistemic cost migrates from generation to verification, echoing how
     cryptographic protocols shift effort to brute-force adversaries.
4. Outlook
Locality thus serves as the bridge between two domains:
Physics     Curvature is reconstructed from locally flat patches.
Computation        Global correctness is reconstructed from locally checkable clauses.
   Hypercomputational theories elevate this bridge to an epistemic principle:
                               Knowledge = Locally Verifiable Coherence
irrespective of the causal or computational path by which it arises.
