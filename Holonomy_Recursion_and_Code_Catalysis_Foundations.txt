Scope and core objects
These notes assemble the precise geometric, dynamical, and information-theoretic foundations un-
derlying (i) self-measurement and closed-loop transport, (ii) cloning versus touching an origin with
self-reference (hyper-recursion), and (iii) code-catalyzed emergence of meaning.
Spacetime and gauge structure. Let M be a smooth spacetime manifold. Let P (M, G) be a prin-
cipal G-bundle with connection A ∈ Ω1 (P, g) inducing curvature F = dA + A ∧ A. For a representation
G ↷ V , the associated bundle is E = P ×G V .
States and transport. A (classical/quantum) internal state lives in a fiber V (or Hilbert space H).
Transport along a path γ is governed by the path-ordered exponential
                               Z 
                 U (γ) = P exp     A ∈ G,       with Wilson loop W (γ) = tr U (γ).
                                     γ
                           H
The closed-loop integral   γ
                               A · dℓ captures gauge phases (Aharonov–Bohm/Berry).
Information and codes. Raw data strings are denoted x. Model class (decoders) M. Kolmogorov
complexity K(·) is used as a formal ideal; in practice, replace by universal codes/MDL proxies. A
stabilizer code on n subsystems with parameters [[n, k, d]] encodes k logical units and corrects up to
t = ⌊(d − 1)/2⌋ errors.
1    Geometric non-return under closed transport
Definition 1 (Holonomy action). For a closed loop γ ⊂ M , holonomy acts on v ∈ V as v 7→ U (γ) v.
Lemma 1 (Generic non-return). If the curvature F does not vanish on any surface spanning γ, then
generically U (γ) ̸= 1. Hence a point-like state that is parallel transported around γ does not return to
its initial internal state.
Remark 1. By the (non-Abelian) Stokes theorem, U (γ) departs from 1 to first order with the integrated
curvature over a spanning surface. Thus “same coordinates” ⇒ “same state.”
2    Extended systems as loop codes (communication ⇒ com-
     munity)
Let an extended loop be parameterized by θ ∈ S 1 with field ψ(θ) ∈ V . Include covariant spatial
derivative Dθ ψ = ∂θ ψ + Aθ (θ)ψ and internal coupling via a kernel K:
                                         Z
                                 ψ̇(θ) =    K(θ, θ′ ) J(ψ(θ′ ), ψ(θ)) dθ′ .
                                            S1
                                                                          1
Definition 2 (Holonomy-invariant code subspace). A subspace C ⊂ V S is holonomy-invariant if for
every fundamental loop γ of the ambient bundle, the induced action satisfies U (γ) · ψ = ψ for all ψ ∈ C.
Proposition 1 (Community invariance under transport). If the representation V contains a trivial
subrepresentation and the coupling K stabilizes that sector, there exists a nonempty C invariant under
all U (γ). An extended, communicating loop prepared in C preserves its global identity under closed
transport despite nontrivial curvature.

3    Cloning vs. touching the origin: fixed points and hyper-
     recursion
Cloning (branching) from a snapshot. Let ρ0 be an initial state. Branches evolve as ρi (t) =
Ui (t)ρ0 Ui† (t) with independent generators Ui (t); ρ0 is untouched and unconstrained by the branches.
Touching the origin (self-consistency).
Definition 3 (Deutsch-type fixed point). For a completely positive, trace-preserving (CPTP) map
Φ : N → N on the convex, compact set of density matrices N , an “origin” state ρ⋆ is a fixed point if
                                                      ρ⋆ = Φ(ρ⋆ ).
Theorem 1 (Existence of fixed points). By Schauder’s fixed point theorem, any continuous Φ on
compact convex N admits at least one fixed point ρ⋆ .
Proposition 2 (Hyper-recursive sensitivity). If Φ depends on a controllable “origin channel” parame-
ter, Φ ≡ Φλ , then the selection of fixed points Fix(Φλ ) can change discontinuously at bifurcation values
of λ. Modifying the origin channel reselects globally consistent branches.
Self-reference in computation (sound abstraction). Lawvere’s and Kleene’s fixed-point/recursion
theorems imply: in any setting that can represent and apply self-descriptions, there exist x with
x ≃ F (x). This provides a categorical/computational analogue of the physical fixed points above.
4    Two-boundary consistency (Novikov-style without paradox)
Let the dynamics minimize an action S[q] subject to initial and final boundary constraints Bi , Bf . In-
troduce Lagrange multipliers enforcing q(ti ) ∈ Bi , q(tf ) ∈ Bf . Euler–Lagrange equations with boundary
terms yield solutions consistent with both boundaries. Emotionally salient events acting as “doors” are
simply boundary-compatible solutions (no contradiction if a solution exists).
5    Code catalysis: semantic phase transition from noise
Definition 4 (Semantic order parameter via MDL). For data x and model class M, define
                                                               
                              K(x) − minM ∈M K(M ) + K(x | M )
                      Ξ(x) :=                                    ∈ [0, 1],
                                            K(x)
interpreting K by MDL/idealized coding. Ξ(x) > 0 iff some model compresses x (structure ⇒ meaning).
   Let subsystems X1 , . . . , Xn interact on a graph G with coupling κ. A robust, computable multi-
variable dependence measure is the total correlation (multi-information)
                                                     n
                                                     X
                           Tκ (X1 , . . . , Xn ) =         H(Xi ) − H(X1 , . . . , Xn ) ≥ 0.
                                                     i=1
Definition 5 (Catalysis threshold). A coupling κc is a (model-dependent) semantic onset if, for a family
of inputs of increasing length, there is a nonzero jump in expected compressive gain and dependence:
                                                                           
                     lim E Ξκc +ϵ − E Ξκc −ϵ > 0,      lim E Tκc +ϵ − E Tκc −ϵ > 0.
                     ϵ↓0                                          ϵ↓0
Example 1 (Mean-field information network). For mean-field, weakly-noisy interacting chains (Ising-
like dependence on features), standard bifurcation analysis yields a pitchfork at κc where a low-
complexity global code emerges; empirical MDL improves abruptly. This is the operative sense of
“code catalysis.”

6     Information geometry of rapid internal updates
Classical. On a statistical manifold of models P, the Fisher–Rao line element ds2 = gij (θ) dθi dθj
induces geodesic distance equal to the symmetrized information divergence for infinitesimal steps.
Quantum. For pure states, the Fubini–Study distance is
                                          
                               s |ψ⟩ , |ϕ⟩ = 2 arccos ⟨ψ|ϕ⟩ .
Large calendar-time separations can correspond to small geodesic distances in model/state space; up-
dates in P or projective Hilbert space can therefore appear “instantaneous” without violating relativistic
signaling constraints in M .
7     Entropy/cryptographic bounds for loop identity preserva-
      tion
Let a loop of radius R and energy budget E traverse an environment with maximum entropy exchange
bounded by the Bekenstein-type limit
                                                    2πkB ER
                                           Smax ≤           .
                                                       ℏc
The corresponding bit budget is Bmax = Smax /(kB ln 2). If at most w ≤ Bmax independent error
operators can be injected during transport, a stabilizer code with distance d satisfying
                                               d > 2w + 1
can correct all such errors and preserve the encoded identity (logical subspace) under holonomy and
noise. In lattice-gauge/topological-order language, loop logicals stabilized by Wilson operators enjoy
the same protection.
8     “Self-fields” and self-measurement (precise use)
A point-like system whose dynamics depend on its own field (e.g. a renormalized self-action) is a closed,
local feedback system. Its instantaneous state is a fixed point of a local response functional F :
                                            ψ 7→ F [ψ] 7→ ψ.
This is dynamical self-consistency, not perception; it explains why a point self is maximally holonomy-
sensitive, while an extended code can distribute and protect identity.
9     Minimal, falsifiable testbeds
    1. Geometric non-return: simulate transport on a ring with nontrivial A; measure ∥U (γ)v0 − v0 ∥.
       Add a holonomy-invariant code C and verify invariance within C.
    2. Origin fixed points: iterate a CPTP map Φλ on density matrices; locate fixed points; vary λ
       to observe bifurcations (hyper-recursive sensitivity).
    3. Catalysis threshold: generate interacting sequences with tunable coupling κ; estimate MDL-
       based Ξ and total correlation Tκ ; detect κc where both rise sharply.

Key equations (retained at a glance)
