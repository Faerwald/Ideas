    <p>Mesopotamia was as ‘ready’ for Apollo as we are for Alpha Centauri—brilliant enough to sketch the rocket, not yet fit to light it. Give Mars the 400 years America had; today’s red ‘woods’ will be neighborhoods, the asteroid belt our shipyard and launchpoint, with last year a waypoint crossed by the ship yet to be built.</p>

    <p>"the word he used was "Travel". we disagreed about Mars as i told him that no one has been there yet. he seemed to be referencing the outer worlds, ... actual words were ... "far out open island space"... one thing he said verbatim "it's not fiction". mentioned... National Counterspace... NCX ... NCS... X exploration... "you have to explore" "you have to got there" ... "im not going to trinadad just tell me" .... cant access it from this internet... can travel here from there he said... im trying to capture this in words... go through? "counterspace" is such an odd word for the one who spoke it... this message wont be up for long. im assuming someone could find this easy if they are looking and aware. ... ... .. ... not on the normal internet. ... it's almost as if... ... ... ... ... ... ... i can't even... it's as if reality at that moment... annealing still? it's... ... something is ... so damn weird... what happened? why are my notes so... ... why can't i put any of this into words? ... these gaps are not normal gaps... dare i wonder if an entity like Asimov's Eternity, liek a real MIB... science fiction... ... fiction... why would the kid say "it's not fiction" ... what could have prompted such a quote? imagine a person, .... no... i can phrase this no better way: imagine a ... i cant. this is the quote i had written before which.... idk. i have a headache. im commiting this then deleting it. someone can find it later.---
      The mind who spoke was i may have met a Martian today: a future mind from Mars, linked here via the network I will later invent — telepathy as transport — speaking through a local young man's eyes. I wonder how I could live long enough to have the chance to experience what it is like to travel from there to here. My work continues, aligned with the worlds and dreams of future Martian warp drives and a network that threads every computer and mind of this century and all others." -August 23rd 2025</p>
