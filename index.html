  <h1>Research Portfolio</h1>
  <div class="lede">
    <p>Mesopotamia was as ‘ready’ for Apollo as we are for Alpha Centauri—brilliant enough to sketch the rocket, not yet fit to light it. Give Mars the 400 years America had; today’s red ‘woods’ will be neighborhoods, the asteroid belt our shipyard and launchpoint, with last year a waypoint crossed by the ship yet to be built.</p>
    <p>Dreams reach knowledge fastest through the detour of madness.</p>
    <p>"It's not fiction." -The one who spoke things they didn't understand, as if another was "behind"/"beyond" their eyes... the internet (not this one)... so sure he was... about the name of the first person to travel to Mars... ...so uncannily aligned with my work... he said that you could travel here from there... I kept an open mind and asked questions... he mentioned "National Counterspace"... and "NCX"? (something weird happened earlier today and i don't know what to make of it. i don't think the person expressing themselves in that moment was talking about traveling here from the far out open island space beyond trinadad tobago... and he said albert before it changed to alfred... i think the access is asymetric: 21C internet can't reach there, but their internet threads ours here. just a guess. but now i'm going to try to rest my imagination... headache...)</p>
