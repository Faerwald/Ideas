  <h1>Research Portfolio</h1>
  <div class="lede">
    <p>Mesopotamia was as ‘ready’ for Apollo as we are for Alpha Centauri—brilliant enough to sketch the rocket, not yet fit to light it. Give Mars the 400 years America had; today’s red ‘woods’ will be neighborhoods, the asteroid belt our shipyard and launchpoint, with last year a waypoint crossed by the ship yet to be built.</p>
    <p>Dreams reach knowledge fastest through the detour of madness.</p>

    <p>Impossibilia amori cedunt.</p>
<p>“It’s not fiction.” — said by someone speaking words they didn’t fully understand, as if another mind were “behind/beyond” their eyes. He referred to an internet — not this one — and spoke with uncanny certainty about the name of the first person to travel to Mars, eerily aligned with my work. He said you could travel here from there. I kept an open mind and asked questions. He mentioned “National Counterspace” and “NCX.” Something strange happened earlier today; I don’t think he meant travel from some far island space beyond Trinidad and Tobago. He said “Albert” before it shifted to “Alfred.” My current guess: access is asymmetric — our 21st-century internet can’t reach them, but their network can thread into ours. For now, I’m going to rest my imagination; I have a headache.</p>
