Longevity Engineering via Time-Locked Benefit
                      Corporations
                            A Mathematical and Strategic Framework
                                             March 3, 2025
                                                Abstract
        Modern corporations often struggle to fund projects requiring multi-decade or century-scale
     commitments due to short-term profit pressures. Governments have historically stepped in for
     ambitious, long-horizon ventures like space exploration, yet there is a new alternative. This
     paper outlines an innovative approach using a benefit corporation model in combination with
     time-locked cryptocurrency holdings (e.g., Bitcoin) to achieve extreme organizational longevity
     and project financing.
        We present:
        • A mathematical analysis of how time-locked investments can compound over successive
          unlocks, ensuring each unlock is greater (relative to the prevailing economy) than the last.
        • Historical insights from longevity engineering, referencing examples of very long-lived en-
          tities (e.g., centuries-old Japanese enterprises).
        • An exploration of how R&D feedback accelerates economic growth, reinforcing the value
          of locked funds and enabling successively grander projects.
        • A speculative—but integral—component of time travel via information transfer, wherein
          an initial “receiver” built in the present can interface with a “transmitter” built centuries
          in the future.
     By tying technological leaps to a patient, mission-driven corporate structure with guaranteed
     future funding, humanity can tackle projects once reserved for state actors—while keeping an
     unwavering focus on long-term benefit over short-term profit.

1     Introduction
Projects that span multiple generations—be they space colonization, advanced fundamental re-
search, or building new forms of infrastructure—require stable funding and governance structures
that can outlast typical corporate lifespans. Historically, only states or large religious institu-
tions have tackled such enormous ventures. Nevertheless, certain private entities have endured for
centuries. For instance, the Japanese construction company Kongō Gumi has existed for over a mil-
lennium in various forms [1]. Such longevity engineering involves governance, succession planning,
and strategic financial practices that ensure resilience across many generations.
    Here, we examine a new mechanism: a Benefit Corporation that uses time-locked cryptocur-
rency investments to achieve similar or greater longevity. The concept rests on:
    I. Time-Locked Financing: Placing capital in cryptographically secured smart contracts that
       unlock at specified intervals—potentially stretching over centuries.
    II. Compounding Value Growth: Relying on the natural increase of economic productivity
        (especially if advanced R&D is funded) to outpace any partial withdrawals.
 III. Mission-Centric Governance: The Benefit Corporation’s legally enshrined purpose super-
      sedes short-term profits, allowing it to focus on ambitious, long-range goals.
 IV. Information Transfer Across Time: A speculative element—yet central to the plan—where
     advanced hardware eventually serves as a transmitter to deliver insights back to an early “re-
     ceiver” device. While physically unproven, the notion captures how R&D breakthroughs
     might appear earlier when guided by future knowledge or high-level inference.
1.1    Paper Roadmap
Section 2 briefly surveys historical precedents for long-lived enterprises. Section 3 details how
cryptographic time locks function, with a focus on Bitcoin’s scripting capabilities. Section 4 provides
                                                   2
a mathematical model illustrating how the principal can grow across staged unlocks. Section 5
discusses the feedback loop by which advanced R&D can accelerate economic growth, further
raising the locked principal’s value. Section 6 clarifies how a Benefit Corporation structure can
maintain mission fidelity over centuries. Finally, Section 7 outlines the conceptual time-travel-
through-dreams aspect, focusing on the “receiver now, transmitter later” logic.
2     Historical Lessons on Longevity Engineering
2.1    Long-Lived Institutions
Human history contains examples of entities enduring centuries, and in rare cases, over a thousand
years:
    • Kongō Gumi (578–present): A Japanese construction firm historically operated by succes-
      sive generations.
    • St. Peter’s Stiftskulinarium (803–present): A restaurant in Austria surviving wars,
      regime changes, and economic upheavals.
These institutions often emphasize:
    1. Stable Governance and Succession: Clearly defined roles passing knowledge and author-
       ity through generations.
    2. Conservative Financial Practices: Avoiding over-leverage and investing for the long run.
    3. Adaptation to Social and Technological Change: Continuous reinvention without losing
       core identity.
2.2    From Tradition to Cryptographic Time Locks
While historically longevity depended on familial lineages or religious/monarchic protection, mod-
ern cryptography enables automated, protocol-driven constraints that outlast any single human
lifetime. The viability of a multi-century “lock” can be ensured through decentralized validation,
reducing reliance on local or ephemeral power structures.
3     Time-Locked Funding Mechanisms
3.1    Foundations in Bitcoin Script
Bitcoin includes nLockTime and script opcodes (e.g., OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY) that can restrict
spending until a certain block height or timestamp. This mechanism:
    • Ensures Immutability: Once locked, funds cannot be accessed until the designated time,
      removing the temptation for early liquidation.
    • Removes Organizational Conflict: The cryptographic protocol enforces the schedule, so
      boards or stakeholders cannot prematurely raid the treasury.
Additional layers (e.g., second-layer solutions or multi-sig approaches) can refine access rules to
require certain conditions beyond time (like project milestones or external oracles).
                                                3
3.2    Multi-Layer Unlock Strategy
A canonical design might include seven major unlock points spread over centuries:
    1) Year 25
    2) Year 50
    3) Year 100
    4) Year 200
    5) Year 300
    6) Year 500
    7) Year 700+ (or 1000)
Each unlock disburses a fraction of the holdings, while the remainder is re-locked for subsequent
intervals. As the following sections show, if the principal experiences growth commensurate with
or exceeding typical market growth, each stage’s absolute value can be larger than the previous
one—despite partial withdrawals.
4     Mathematical Model of Growth and Unlocks
4.1    Basic Variables
    • V0 : Initial investment (e.g., $10,000 to $100,000 in Bitcoin or a basket of cryptoassets).
    • tn : The specific time (in years) of the n-th unlock.
    • ∆n : The fraction (or absolute amount) withdrawn at unlock n.
    • r(t): The effective growth rate of the asset over time, influenced by:
        a) Baseline technological/economic growth.
        b) Boost from the Benefit Corporation’s own innovations (discussed in Section 5).
4.2    Discrete Compound Model
A straightforward approach treats each interval [tn−1 , tn ] with an effective growth factor Gn :
                                               Z tn            !
                                   Gn = exp          r(τ ) dτ .
                                                  tn−1
Then, if Vn−1 is the value right after the (n − 1)-th unlock, we have:
                                                     
                                         Vn = Vn−1 × Gn ,
and the amount available at unlock n is
                                            ∆n = θn · Vn ,
where θn is the fraction to be withdrawn at that stage (e.g., 10%, 20%, etc.). The new principal
that remains locked is
                                Vn(remain) = Vn − ∆n = (1 − θn ) Vn .
                                                  4
4.3    Ensuring Greater Absolute Unlocks Over Time
For each stage n, the unlocked amount ∆n can exceed the previous stage’s total distribution ∆n−1
if:
                               ∆n = θn · Vn > ∆n−1 = θn−1 · Vn−1 .
Even if θn ≤ θn−1 , the underlying growth factor Gn could drive Vn high enough to exceed ∆n−1 .
Concretely, suppose for simplicity θn = θ (a constant fraction) across unlocks, and a uniform growth
factor G each interval:
                                     Vn = G Vn−1 , ∆n = θ Vn .
We want ∆n > ∆n−1 ⇐⇒ θ G Vn−1 > θ Vn−1 ⇐⇒ G > 1. In other words, if G > 1, each
unlock grows proportionally. Over multiple centuries, if r(t) remains positive on average (which is
historically consistent with broad economic and technological growth), the compounding effect will
ensure each new unlock is bigger in absolute terms.
4.4    Relative Value with Respect to GDP
A crucial point is that the relative value of ∆n in the future economy might remain significant or
even grow. For instance, if world GDP grows at γ% per year, and the locked asset’s average growth
rate is on par or higher, the fraction of global capital controlled by the corporation can remain
constant or expand. This phenomenon is magnified when the corporation’s own developments fuel
that very growth, creating a virtuous feedback loop.
5     Feedback Loop: Advanced R&D and Economic Growth
Unlike passive investors, the Benefit Corporation actively innovates, creating technologies with
large economic impacts (e.g., improved computing, robotics, space infrastructure). Each time an
unlock occurs, it invests in ambitious R&D. Successful breakthroughs:
    • Increase overall productivity or open new markets.
    • Stimulate higher asset valuations (including the corporation’s locked crypto).
    • Provide additional returns that can be reinvested or partially locked again, perpetuating the
      cycle.
Historically, major technological leaps (steam engine, electricity, digital computing) have triggered
surges in economic output. By harnessing a portion of such surges, the locked principal can appre-
ciate faster than the baseline growth rate alone.
6     Benefit Corporation Model for Long-Horizon Projects
6.1    Legal Structure
A Benefit Corporation is a legal entity form where directors are obligated to consider the public
or mission-oriented benefit, not just shareholder profit. This codified mission can include:
    1. Long-term R&D in space infrastructure or sustainable technology.
    2. Ethical guidelines for advanced AI or biotech.
                                                 5
      3. Funding extremely ambitious science (e.g., large-scale quantum computing, “dream-based”
         time travel research).
      Because the mission is legally binding, shareholders cannot force near-term profit extraction
  to the detriment of the centuries-spanning vision. The corporate charter stipulates the time-lock
  schedule, ensuring these funds cannot be diverted.
  6.2     Private-Sector Approach to Traditionally Government-Led Ventures
  Space travel, fundamental physics experiments, or even large-scale climate projects often fall to
  government agencies due to high cost and uncertain returns. The time-lock mechanism counters
  this dilemma:
       • Guaranteed future funding → M inimizesriskof abandonedlong−termprojects.Large, patientcapital →
         Allowspursuitof extremelyexpensiveorvisionaryendeavors.
• Benefit-driven governance → Alignswithhumanity ′ sbroadinterests, ratherthanshort − runprof it.
  7      Time Travel Through Dreams: First Receiver, Final Transmit-
         ter
  Though speculative, the plan envisions using the first unlock to begin building an informational
  “receiver”—an advanced computational-neural interface that could, in principle, receive knowl-
  edge streams from a future “transmitter.” The final transmitter might not exist until centuries
  later, financed by the seventh or ultimate unlock.
  7.1     Conceptual Rationale
       • Accelerating Discovery: If future civilization masters certain forms of quantum or neuro-
         logical “time entanglement,” early R&D teams may glean crucial data.
       • Verifiable Results: Even if the “signal” is subtle (e.g., in the form of dream insights), each
         new idea is tested rigorously for scientific validity. Plausible leaps become integrated into the
         R&D roadmap.
       • Cultural Mindset: Encourages bold, imaginative exploration. This fosters a mental envi-
         ronment where high-risk, high-reward ideas are given serious scrutiny instead of being dis-
         missed out of hand.
  7.2     Practical Perspective
  From a purely pragmatic standpoint (ignoring literal backward causation), the “receiver-transmitter”
  concept can be viewed as a structured approach to:
   (a) Generate a wide array of advanced solutions and theoretical constructs.
   (b) Select and refine them using AI/human synergy, focusing on those that appear mathematically
       and physically consistent, or show early empirical promise.
      (c) Design the future from the present, so that tomorrow’s breakthroughs effectively become
          “pre-imagined,” making them more likely to be discovered sooner.

8     Conclusion
8.1    Key Insights
    • Longevity Engineering: By encoding time locks in a legally protected Benefit Corporation,
      the organization can outlast typical corporate lifecycles and maintain stable, mission-focused
      funding.
    • Mathematical Growth Guarantee: If the growth rate of locked assets (or their underlying
      economy) remains positive, each unlock can be strictly larger in absolute terms—even as
      partial withdrawals are made.
    • Feedback Loop: Ambitious R&D catalyzes broader economic expansion, which, in turn,
      boosts the value of locked holdings.
    • Expanding the Horizon: Freed from short-term profit pressure, the corporation can tackle
      historically government-led projects—such as large-scale space exploration—while preserving
      a public-benefit orientation.
    • Dream-Based Time Travel (Receiver/Transmitter): A futuristic notion that symbol-
      izes how carefully orchestrated present-day research can glean advanced insights—potentially
      from future technologies—thereby accelerating progress.
8.2    Future Outlook
The combination of cryptographic time locks, Benefit Corporation governance, and an emphasis
on R&D that feeds back into economic growth establishes a practical blueprint for super-long-term
innovation. Whether or not the more speculative “time travel through dreams” can be realized
literally, this visionary mindset fosters the kind of imaginative, yet disciplined research culture that
has historically driven human progress.
    Historically, we have seen that longevity in an organization requires consistent leadership, strong
culture, and prudent financial structures. Cryptographic time-locked funding extends this principle,
placing it on a mathematically enforced and globally verifiable foundation. If humanity avoids
existential catastrophe and continues to advance, the ability to draw ever-larger unlocks of capital
over centuries could revolutionize how we plan and execute grand ventures—and perhaps even make
those “impossible” dreams a tangible reality.
