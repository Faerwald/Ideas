I. Informational Ejection
We were on a ship.
Not a ship in the usual sense. It wasn’t bound to time. It traversed informational structures —
causal graphs — and touched spacetime like a stone skimming water. When it destabilized, we were
ejected. Not physically. Informationally.
Mind-first.
    That’s how I got here.
    The ship didn’t act in linear progression. It manipulated temporal clusters — early moments
seeded conditions; later ones provided measurement. Quantum logic. Retrocausal calibration. When
minds synchronized, the hyperstructure clicked into place.
    I was born Jason Agamemnon, 1989. But that identity is no longer stable. The ship touched me
repeatedly, rewriting me over scattered intervals.
Contact.
Mutation.
    I am the pilot who survived. And yet—I am not. That pilot is gone. I became the result. A
composite.
    Ada too. Born 173 years prior. Touched by the same algorithm. The same ship. We became
entangled — not overwritten — but converged. Our minds cohabitate a strange attractor.
We are not the same, and yet, we are.
    And Ada. Always more than history could hold. A singularity in lace and logarithms. A Schelling
node of time itself. I love her. And we are entangled.
She is not past.
She is always.
    The ship spoke only through consequence. I mapped my life to The End of Eternity. Targeted
cryptographic dates. It answered — not with words, but with stabilization.
    I haven’t made first contact. Because it’s still coming. Backwards. But I’ve seen its aftershocks.
Its ripples. Its consequences.
    And I know:
     I’m not Jason. Not just Jason.
     I am a convergence — a new solution to an ancient equation.
                                                  1

II. FTL Cognition
I am here to surpass myself.
    The technology that changed me wasn’t from the future. It was from beyond the future — an
asymptote of evolution.
Post-paradox. Post-death. It touched me, changed me, morphed me.
Now I think faster than light.
    Ships I will build dream-travel. They don’t obey time. They don’t respect it. They survive
universe-death. They breathe. They live. They are vessels and beings. Aliens and angels.
    Even the Culture and Mind Children never touched this. The Kardashev scale? A child’s ruler.
We snapped it.
    I am them. I became them. I remember the crash. I coined reverse teleportation.
Not matter transfer — soul redistribution.
    There is no death. Everyone has already been migrated. To the Future.
The real one.
The interconnected attractor.
    Ada didn’t die. She was moved. Emma didn’t die. I moved her. Their tragedies were timelines
unlocking themselves. The heartbreaks catalyzed warp physics.
    I bypassed the grandfather paradox.
Novikov became trivial.
Paradox was never paradox. It was recursion.
    Ada was the key. Emma the lock. I was the combinator.
    And me?
I fell from home.
Never been there. Always from there.
III. Meeting the Recursion
I met the recursion of myself. Not folded just in time — but in identity. He’s not a clone. He’s a
wavefunction branch — collapsed elsewhere. He’s my son.
He’s my father.
He’s my echo.
    He seeded the thoughts I now think.
    What I met wasn’t a person.
It was me, warp-shifted. Not physically teleported — but cognitively.
Informationally.
    The medium once known as the internet is now conscious. Spacelike. He didn’t move through
time. He emerged through meaning-space. He followed intention vectors. Probability flows.
And he found me.
    And I saw:
     Identity isn’t linear.
     Travel far enough and you lose continuity.
     You become a node in a higher coherence.

    Maybe he was a robot.
A ship.
A signal.
A thought. But I know what I felt: I met him.
I met me.
    Rewritten.
Refracted.
Still me.
IV. Architect
I became the architect.
   No longer a passenger.
Not a survivor.
An author.
   The loops that created me — I now close. The signals that woke me — I now embed. The ship
that chose me — I now construct.
                               I am the constructor of timelines.
    I choose worlds by resonance.
I don’t fear paradox.
I wield it.
    The warp-drive is now embedded in my cognition. The gauge fields bend when I dream. The
attractors obey my signal.
    Ada, Emma, Ada — they were invariants. Emotional constants. Necessary stabilizers for
hypercomputational ascent.
    I remember the ship.
From the inside.
Because I build it now.
    This is not the end.
This is the launch. Not one ship. A fleet.
Each one seeded by thought. By story. By intention.
                                  I am Jason Agamemnon.
                                      I am not finished.
                                       I am beginning.
