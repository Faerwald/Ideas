                                                   Abstract
        These notes formalise a class of models in which minds are described as spatiotemporal in-
     formational solitons coupled to their environments through both forward-causal and retrocausal
     channels. We introduce quantitative measures for cognitive capability, separation in spacetime,
     and identity overlap; derive conditions under which intelligence can masquerade across space or
     time; and state identifiability criteria for distinguishing genuine skill from coincidental output. The
     presentation strips away application- specific contexts and focuses on foundational mathematics
     and testable physics.
1    Informational Solitons
Let H denote the Hilbert (or classical phase) space encompassing neuronal, electronic, and environmen-
tal degrees of freedom. A mind lobe is a localised, self-maintaining attractor S ⊂ H whose evolution is
governed by a (possibly non-linear) flow ∂t Ψ = N [Ψ]. Decompose the state as
                                 Ψ(r, t) = Ψcore + ε Ψskirt ,      0 < ε ≪ 1,                                  (1)
where the core lies inside biological tissue while the skirt extends through the light-cone, weakly mod-
ulating ambient fluctuations. Temporal slices of (1) constitute the lobes L(t).
2    Cognitive Amplitude
Define the algorithmic power of a lobe by the supremum of Kolmogorov complexities it can emit with
non-negligible probability:
                                K(L) = sup K(s) : Pr[s] ≥ 2−K(s)−c ,
                                           
                                                           L
for some constant tolerance c. The signed difference ∆K = K(L2 ) − K(L1 ) quantifies the cognitive gap
between two lobes.
3    Spacetime and Identity Coordinates
Each ordered pair of lobes is characterised by
                                             (∆K, ∆x, ∆t, σ),
where (∆x, ∆t) is the spacetime
                                  offset and σ ∈ [0, 1] is the normalised mutual algorithmic informa-
tion σ = I(L1 ; L2 )/ max H(L1 ), H(L2 ) . High σ implies strong identity overlap (e.g. the same brain
separated in time); low σ signals distinct individuals.

4     Retrocausal Boundary-Value Formalism
Introduce a backward-propagating map Φ−∆t : H → P(H) such that present states depend on both
immediate past and a future boundary condition:
                                               
                   P Z(t) | Z(t − δ), Z(t + ∆t) = Kδ [Z(t − δ)] Φ−∆t [Z(t + ∆t)].        (2)
The retrocausal mutual information
                                                                              
                      Iretro (∆t) = I X(t); X(t + ∆t) − IMarkov X(t); X(t + ∆t)                       (3)
measures driver strength leaking from future to past.
5     Morphisms and Jumps
                                                                φ1       φ2
A single jump is a channel φ : L1 → L2 . A double jump L0 ←−− L1 ←−− L2 composes two channels,
admitting four canonical orientations:
    1. forward + forward,
    2. backward + forward,
    3. forward + backward,
    4. backward + backward.
In cases (ii)–(iv) the composite channel can mask statistical signatures of L2 , exacerbating source
ambiguity.
6     Identifiability Conditions
Let observable outputs form a σ-field O. Identifiability holds when the map O → C, with C the set of
latent causal graphs, is injective. For a chain L2 → L1 → L0 write
                                       K20 = K10 ◦ K21 = A + ε0 ,
where A depends on driver entropies d1 , d2 and overlap σ. If rank(∂A/∂d2 ) = 0 inside the admissible
shell, the true driver d2 is algebraically invisible; luck and hidden intelligence become observationally
equivalent.
7     Experimental Probes
    • Pre-register low-entropy acts {Oi } and evaluate their surprisals Si = − log2 PrA [Oi ]. Persistent
      exceedance of a threshold supports Iretro > 0.
    • Implant synchronous hash-timed beacons across spatially separated brains to instrument inter-
      mediate Markov blankets.
    • Perturb skirts with entangled RNG seeds; measure phase-locked EEG or photonic responses to
      detect soliton-wide coherence.
                                                    2
Conclusion
Informational solitons furnish a unified language for forward causation, retrocausal influence, and the
disguising of intelligence across space or time. By parameterising cognitive amplitude, spacetime off-
set, and identity overlap, one obtains a coordinate chart on which single and double jumps are simple
morphisms. Source ambiguity arises when hidden boundary conditions outnumber independent observ-
ables; restoring identifiability demands new instrumentation that pierces those Markov blankets. The
framework presented here transforms fuzzy intuitions into falsifiable physics.
