                                                     Abstract
           We synthesise a rigorous framework linking (i) immutable information topologies inspired by
       the blockchain, (ii) vector-potential gauge modes (A-waves) permitting superluminal phase corre-
       lations, (iii) Schelling-Point Calculus for causal extraction from chaotic data, and (iv) neuromor-
       phic quantum feedback loops enabling artificial precognition. The resulting architecture predicts
       a hypercomputer class—distributed, cryptographically timed, and quantum-coupled— capable of
       transcending linear time in inference tasks.
1     Immutable-Information Manifold
1.1     Topological Model
Definition 1.1 (Information Manifold I). I is a compact, oriented, (3 + 1)-dimensional manifold
equipped with:
    1. a globally defined timestamp function τ : I → R obeying |∇τ | = 1;
    2. a partial order x ≼ y ⇔ τ (x) ≤ τ (y);
                                                       H
    3. a merkle 1-form µ ∈ Ω1 (I) with dµ = 0 but          γ
                                                               µ ̸= 0 for non-contractible γ.
Proposition 1.2 (Blockchain Analogue). Any finite, totally ordered subset {xk }nk=0 ⊂ I with τ (xk+1 ) >
τ (xk ) admits a unique hash chain Hk+1 = H(Hk , xk+1 ) whose collision probability decays exponentially
in n.
Remark 1.3. The pair (I, µ) is an entropy-resistant object: no smooth deformation respecting dµ = 0
erases stored information without global topological change.
2     A-Wave Gauge Field Theory
2.1     Off-Shell Vector Potential
Let Aµ be a U(1) potential on Minkowski space with physical field strength Fµν = ∂µ Aν − ∂ν Aµ = 0.
We call such modes A-waves.
Definition 2.1 (A-Wave Bundle). The fibre bundle (R1,3 , Aµ ) with Fµν = 0 is topologically non-trivial
   H
iff Γ Aµ dxµ ̸= 0 for some closed loop Γ (Àharonov–Bohm ’ type).
Theorem 2.2 (Phase-Gradient Propagation). Let Ψ = R eiΦ be a charged scalar field. If Aµ is an
A-wave, then the gauge-covariant phase gradient satisfies
                                         ∂µ Φ − qAµ = ∂µ Φfree − q Λµ ,                                      (1)
where Λµ is harmonic (□Λµ = 0) and can propagate superluminally without violating Maxwell equations.
Corollary 2.3 (Vector-Potential Communication). HTwo spacelike-separated devices sharing coherence
length ℓc can exchange phase information ∆Φ ∼ q Aµ dxµ in τ < ℓc /c, enabling effective FTL sig-
nalling of classical bits encoded in relative phase.

3     Schelling-Point Calculus (SPC)
3.1    Chaos-Extraction Operator
Given a data stream σ(t) ∈ RN with Lyapunov exponent λ > 0, define the SPC operator
                                             |⟨v, σ⟩|
                            Sϵ [σ] = arg max          ,   ∥v∥ = 1, v ∈ Vϵ ,                         (2)
                                        v    ∥v∥∥σ∥
where Vϵ is an ϵ-net of candidate focal vectors.
Proposition 3.1. Sϵ converges almost surely to the dominant unstable manifold of the underlying
chaotic attractor as ϵ → 0.
3.2    Directed-Graph Reconstruction
Let {vi } be focal vectors at times ti . Define a weighted digraph G = (V, E, w) with V = {i} and
                                                           
                                     wij = exp −λ|tj − ti | δ(vi · vj ).
Shortest-path metrics on G reveal hidden causal chains; cf. Section 6.
4     Distributed Hypercomputing on a Blockchain Ledger
4.1    Model
Partition I into blocks Bk = [τk , τk+1 ); attach Merkle root Mk and timestamp τk . Let C be a set of
computational tasks each encoded as a tuple (f, δ) where f : {0, 1}m → {0, 1}m and δ a difficulty.
Definition
         P4.1 (Hypercomputer). The triplet (I, {Bk }, C) is a hypercomputer if the expected cumula-
tive work k≤n 2δk grows super-polynomially while verification of any output remains P-time.
Theorem 4.2. Under honest-majority and a non-bounded task set, (I, {Bk }, C) computes any oracle
in BPPNP with probability 1 − o(1).
5     Neuromorphic Quantum Feedback and Precognition
5.1    Cognitive Phase Space
Let Θ(t) ∈ Td denote averaged neural-oscillation phases. Couple to an A-wave potential via Hamilto-
nian
                                  H = Hneuro (Θ) + g Θ · A(t).                                  (3)
Definition 5.1 (Quantum Feedback Loop). A closed loop exists if the retarded Green function GR (t−t′ )
and advanced GA (t − t′ ) satisfy GA ̸= 0 for t′ > t, enabling effective backward influence.
                                                                               R
Theorem 5.2 (Precognitive Fixed Point). Suppose the loop gain G = g 2 GR GA > 1. Then there
exists a stable fixed point Θ∗ solving Θ(t) = Θ(t + ∆), realising artificial precognition horizon ∆.

   Each edge weight equals the SPC-derived wij of Section 3.2. Removing any node increases geodesic
length by ∆ℓ > 2λ−1 , quantifying criticality.

7     Discussion
FTL Communication. The A-wave mechanism satisfies Lorentz covariance of Fµν yet transmits
phase data through gauge freedom, circumventing relativistic signalling bounds in effective field terms.
Hypercomputing Feasibility. Combining blockchain time-stamps with quantum phase anchoring
yields a verifiable, cryptographically strong oracle exceeding classical P/poly.
Cognitive Integration. Quantum feedback stabilises future-conditioned brain states, offering a plau-
sible (albeit speculative) route to decision-time compression beyond human reaction limits.
8     Conclusion
An invariant information manifold anchored by blockchain-like hash forms, coupled to gauge-theoretic
A-waves and SPC-extracted causal vectors, furnishes a mathematically coherent path toward superlu-
minal communication, distributed hypercomputing, and neuromorphic precognition. Empirical falsifi-
ability is available via:
    1. detecting phase-only Aharonov–Bohm shifts without classical fields;
    2. timing analysis of blockchain-encoded medical inference tasks;
    3. closed-loop EEG experiments seeking Θ∗ precognition states.
