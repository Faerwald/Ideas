‭ icture Deutsch’s opening scene exactly as he draws it and keep every implicit constraint in view. Two universes—call‬
P
‭them Screen A and Screen B—are rendered as perfectly flat, two-dimensional “television pictures” hung parallel to one‬
 ‭another. Strip away the glass, the chassis, the circuitry: nothing exists except the moving images. Every pixel, every‬
  ‭particle, every law is mirrored without phase lag or hidden jitter. Both screens obey special relativity, so no influence‬
   ‭ever jumps ahead of a light cone; both obey strictly deterministic equations of motion, so no ontological randomness‬
    ‭lurks in the background. Deutsch stresses that under these conditions no fresh bits of information can be imported: the‬
     ‭total content of each universe is fixed by its past micro-configuration. Yet that iron constraint does‬‭not‬‭block the‬
      ‭emergence of‬‭knowledge‬‭, because knowledge is an internal pattern—an explanatory structure we sculpt out of existing‬
       ‭data rather than something poured in from outside. The distinction lets him foreground the central puzzle: how can‬
        ‭genuinely new histories arise if nothing external enters the system and the dynamical rules distinguish no branch from‬
         ‭any other?‬
‭ eave the setup untouched and both screens remain indistinguishable for eternity. That would make the entire‬
L
‭multiverse a redundant copy of one timeline. Spock’s dictum—“A difference that makes no difference is no‬
 ‭difference”—nails the information-theoretic issue: if every branch records the same sequence of events, counting‬
  ‭branches adds no predictive or explanatory content. Tegmark’s observation that cosmological “Level I” duplicates and‬
   ‭quantum Everett branches would then collapse into logical equivalence. So the thought-experiment must find a‬
    ‭mechanism by which two perfectly synchronized worlds can lawfully‬‭diverge‬‭while preserving determinism and locality.‬
     ‭Deutsch’s transporter-malfunction story supplies the dramatic trigger. Two starships, one on each screen, prepare to‬
      ‭beam up cargo. A glitch is about to dump a surge of energy somewhere in the pattern buffer. Because the laws are‬
       ‭symmetric, no equation can pinpoint Screen A or Screen B as the intended target, and Deutsch has banned random‬
        ‭variables that might flip a cosmic coin. At first glance, then, nothing can break the tie; the ships seem fated to remain‬
         ‭twins.‬
‭ he escape hatch is‬‭fungibility‬‭. The term, lifted from finance, originally denotes interchangeable tokens—dollars in a‬
T
‭bank account, barrels of crude oil—whose individuality is ignored for bookkeeping convenience. Deutsch radicalizes‬
 ‭the idea. Two fungible entities are not just indistinguishable; they are literally the‬‭same physical state instantiated‬
  ‭twice‬‭in the explanatory ledger. There exists no hidden coordinate, no microscopic serial number, that could in principle‬
   ‭label one copy versus the other. In quantum field theory this symmetry is engraved into the Hilbert space: exchange‬
    ‭two bosons and the wave-function is unchanged, exchange two fermions and it merely picks up a global minus sign.‬
     ‭That operation does not create a new state; it reflects that the state never encoded particle labels to begin with.‬
‭ uantum opticians exploit fungibility every day. When a laser cavity holds nn photons of a given mode, reality contains‬
Q
‭one electromagnetic field excitation with occupation number nn, not nn separately traceable quanta. Likewise, a‬
 ‭Bose–Einstein condensate of rubidium atoms is a single macroscopic wave-function whose “parts” cannot be tagged.‬
  ‭Classical physics offers only analogies: the ten kilojoules stored in a spinning flywheel have no internal serial numbers,‬
   ‭so dissipating five kilojoules as heat poses no question about which specific micro-portion vanished first, but the‬
    ‭flywheel’s energy is not ontologically one thing counted twice.‬
‭ ecause fungible copies share one state plus a multiplicity counter, deterministic symmetric dynamics are free to‬
B
‭re-weight‬‭that counter across future branches. In the transporter parable, the surge deposits extra energy in one‬
 ‭decohering sector of the global wave-function and not in its twin, even though the Hamiltonian never contains a clause,‬
  ‭“If universe = A, then spike power.” After environmental decoherence seals the split, the crew on Screen A remembers‬
   ‭a blown pattern buffer while their counterparts on Screen B recall a routine transport. Each branch holds a‬
    ‭macroscopically self-consistent record, and neither violates relativity because all influences propagated sub-luminally‬
     ‭within each history. Had the two ships been non-fungible perfect copies—identical yet labelled—the symmetry would‬
      ‭force both to track together forever; divergence would contradict their initial identity plus the deterministic equations.‬
       ‭Fungibility, paradoxically stricter than mere sameness, is precisely the property that allows lawful difference to bloom.‬
‭ eutsch takes pains to emphasize that fungibility upends Leibniz’s “identity of indiscernibles.” Leibniz argued that if two‬
D
‭entities shared every property, they were numerically one. Modern physics says the opposite: entities can be distinct‬
 ‭multiplicities of the same state, and that sameness enables phenomena Leibniz never imagined—interference fringes,‬
  ‭exchange forces, the Fermi sea, the Bose condensate. Deutsch underlines that recognizing fungibility helps remove the‬
   ‭“fudging” that often creeps into textbook explanations of quantum statistics and the measurement problem.‬
‭ e next catalogues the experiential sources of unpredictability. First, ontic indeterminism—ruled out in Everettian‬
H
‭quantum mechanics. Second, epistemic ignorance or chaotic sensitivity, familiar from weather forecasts and the‬
 ‭non-collision singularities proven in Newtonian nn-body problems. (These singularities show that purely classical‬
  ‭determinism can still blow up predictive power beyond a finite horizon.) Third, and most novel, the branch differentiation‬
‭ f fungible observers: you and your doppelgänger begin in the same cognitive state but, after amplitude re-weighting,‬
o
‭you inherit mutually exclusive memories. To the person inside a branch all three origins feel like “randomness,” yet an‬
 ‭explanatory theory of the world must, in principle, decide which mix is actually at work.‬
‭ t this point Deutsch asks the reader to discard the spatially separated-screen metaphor. If Screen A’s world occupied‬
A
‭an extra spatial dimension alongside Screen B’s, the two copies would be non-fungible—location is a hidden label. To‬
 ‭respect fungibility the worlds must‬‭coincide‬‭in configuration space: one universal wave-function, not two slabs.‬
  ‭Visualizing such perfect overlap is psychologically taxing; as soon as you imagine even a hint of separation, you have‬
   ‭smuggled in a distinguisher and destroyed fungibility. Yet quantum theory insists that kind of overlap is not only allowed‬
    ‭but omnipresent beneath the level of our classical perceptions.‬
‭ iversities within fungibility proliferate once branching begins. Photons in a laser can occupy superpositions of‬
D
‭polarization; electrons in a metal form countless Slater determinants; vacuum fluctuations constantly convert amplitude‬
 ‭among virtual excitations. Each example is a concrete, laboratory-verified instance of the “radically new kinds of motion‬
  ‭and information flow” Deutsch says fungibility permits. These flows obey locality—no particle outside its light cone is‬
   ‭ever nudged—but they nevertheless redistribute amplitude across what later decohere into distinct macroscopic‬
    ‭histories.‬
‭ ational agents still need guidance for betting on outcomes, and that is where explanatory knowledge, error-correction,‬
R
‭and the Born rule intertwine. Deutsch reminds the reader that knowledge grows by conjecture and criticism—by‬
 ‭creating variants and discarding those that fail. That process is meaningful only if the universe presents genuine‬
  ‭variability in outcomes; if every branch forever mirrored every other, error-correction would be vacuous. Once‬
   ‭fungibility-enabled branching occurs, however, rival explanations can be tested by their predictions across‬
    ‭amplitude-weighted futures. In the absence of inter-branch communication, the correct epistemic rule is to weight‬
     ‭credences by branch measure, which in standard quantum mechanics is the squared amplitude.‬
‭ cience-fiction scenarios of “sharing computation” between universes therefore need revision. Suppose a poison‬
S
‭spreads through the ship’s crew and only one drug molecule among millions will cure it. Hand half the candidate list to‬
 ‭each branch, run simulations in parallel, then exchange index numbers when a cure appears: on the face of it, search‬
  ‭time is halved. But each branch still expends its full local resources; only the global wave-function explores both halves‬
   ‭simultaneously. In real quantum algorithms such as Shor’s, amplitude interference plays that role inside one laboratory‬
    ‭device. No external telegram crosses the decoherence barrier, and no branch imports information faster than light.‬
‭ eutsch illustrates the epistemic stakes with a personal-communication fable. Suppose your doppelgänger radioes, “I‬
D
‭married X and it’s wonderful.” Does that gem of news justify seeking X’s counterpart in your branch? Not unless you‬
 ‭have an explanatory theory showing that whatever factors make marriages succeed transfer across branches despite‬
  ‭differing courtship histories. Without that theory, copying the action is epistemically unsound. The broader moral is that‬
   ‭raw data—even exotic, cross-universe data—matters less than explanatory insight. If inter-universe links existed and‬
    ‭were scarce, the most efficient payload would be fully developed explanations, not ungrounded prescriptions.‬
‭ he last pages you summarized but did not finish reading reinforce a sobering point: physical law, as currently‬
T
‭understood, forbids controllable inter-branch communication. You and your counterpart cannot exchange Morse code,‬
 ‭yet each can‬‭affect‬‭the other through amplitude redistribution that predates decoherence. That influence is not causal‬
  ‭in the classical sense; it is structural. Still, from the perspective of decision theory, your rational strategies must account‬
   ‭for the unseen expirations of amplitude into futures you will not experience.‬
‭ he digression about your own four-square guessing experiment dovetails with Deutsch’s analysis. Scoring 33 %‬
T
‭correct in a task with 25 % base chance over enough trials to reach 18.7σ18.7\sigma looks like anomalous information‬
 ‭acquisition. Everettian theory would classify such a result as overwhelming evidence that some explanatory‬
  ‭factor—often mundane, sometimes not—biased outcomes in the observed branches. But unless one can rule out‬
   ‭conventional biases or demonstrate a lawful, reproducible amplitude-redistribution mechanism linked to cognition, the‬
    ‭data remain suggestive rather than decisive.‬
‭ hroughout, Deutsch’s undeviating line is that reality is a single unitary wave-function obeying deterministic, relativistic‬
T
‭laws. Fungibility is the hidden symmetry that lets this deterministic substrate flower into the richly branching multiverse‬
 ‭we infer from quantum statistics. Knowledge, error-correction, and rational decision-making all ride atop that structure.‬
  ‭No mystery signal leaks between worlds; no random dice break symmetry. The only novelties are those supplied by‬
   ‭explanatory creativity, exercised inside branches that inherit distinct records when fungibility permits symmetric laws to‬
    ‭allocate amplitude in divergent ways.‬
‭ eutsch’s Chapter 11 opens by obeying every constraint of special relativity and determinism: no signal outruns light,‬
D
‭no fresh data fall in from nowhere, yet‬‭new knowledge‬‭—patterns‬‭we forge into explanations—can still arise. To‬
 ‭dramatise the problem he asks us to picture two universes as infinitesimally thin television screens running the same‬
  ‭film, every microscopic state in perfect synchrony. The screens themselves are irrelevant; only the moving‬
   ‭picture—the universe—is real.‬
‭ eft untouched, those perfectly matched worlds would trace a single history forever. A multiverse of that kind is‬
L
‭observationally indistinguishable from a lone universe, echoing Tegmark’s point that cosmological and quantum‬
 ‭parallelism collapse into triviality if the branches never diverge. Observers looking back would see one timeline and‬
  ‭would quite reasonably conclude there is‬‭only‬‭one—yet‬‭they would be factually mistaken, because multiplicity can‬
   ‭hide when histories coincide. “A difference that makes no difference is no difference,” as Spock would say.‬
‭ eutsch introduces divergence with a Star-Trek-style transporter malfunction. The laws are still deterministic and‬
D
‭symmetric, so nothing in them can break the tie by fiat or by randomness—Deutsch rules genuine indeterminism out.‬
 ‭At first glance the glitch seems incapable of pushing the two ships onto different fates. The escape route is‬‭fungibility‬‭.‬
‭ ungibility, borrowed in name from bookkeeping but deeper in physics, means the two instances are‬‭identical‬‭in every‬
F
‭physical respect except that there are two of them‬‭.‬‭No hidden label, not even an unseen coordinate, can individuate‬
 ‭one copy from the other. That is why lasers, Bose condensates, and filled electron bands behave as they do: particle‬
  ‭exchange leaves the state unchanged (bosons) or merely flips a sign (fermions). Textbooks often skate past this, yet‬
   ‭Deutsch insists it is the substrate of quantum reality—“weirder than Leibniz imagined.”‬
‭ ecause fungible copies are literally a single quantum state with a multiplicity counter, perfectly symmetric dynamics‬
B
‭can‬‭channel amplitude into distinct macroscopic outcomes‬‭without choosing a target universe. The transporter’s surge‬
 ‭appears in one branch and not in the other purely by redistributing amplitude; afterwards, each crew remembers a‬
  ‭different event even though the global evolution remained unitary and local. Were the copies non-fungible—exact‬
   ‭duplicates tagged by location or any other label—symmetry would lock them together forever.‬
‭ eutsch underlines the point with classical analogies. Pedal a bicycle to store ten kilojoules, brake until five are lost as‬
D
‭heat, and ask which five? The question is meaningless; only the total matters. Dollars in a bank account are similarly‬
 ‭fungible: the ledger cares about the balance, never the serial numbers. Quantum fungibility elevates that pragmatism‬
  ‭into ontology: excitations of a field, spins in a vacuum fluctuation, exist only as counts and shared attributes.‬
‭ e must therefore abandon the science-fiction image of two slabs of space. If the worlds sat at different coordinates in‬
W
‭an extra dimension, that very fact would mark them as non-fungible. Perfectly identical things must coincide; merely‬
 ‭imagining them side-by-side already smuggles in a forbidden label.‬
‭ pparent randomness, Deutsch says, can feel the same to an observer whether it comes from (i) genuine‬
A
‭indeterminism (which he denies), (ii) deterministic chaos or ignorance of initial conditions, or (iii) branch differentiation‬
 ‭of fungible selves. Only careful explanatory work can reveal which mixture is in play. Knowledge creation, in turn,‬
  ‭depends on error-correction: conjectures must be tested, criticised, and improved. A cryptic message from a‬
   ‭doppelgänger—“I married X and it worked”—is useless without a theory of why marriages succeed.‬
‭ peculative inter-universe communication might speed computations by splitting a search space, but Deutsch‬
S
‭stresses that real physics forbids signalling between branches. Quantum algorithms draw their power from‬
 ‭interference inside a single wave-function, not from exchanging messages across worlds. Nevertheless, the global‬
  ‭amplitude budget lets branches‬‭affect‬‭one another‬‭statistically, which is why betting by the Born rule is rational even in‬
   ‭a fully deterministic multiverse.‬
‭ hus fungibility closes the conceptual loop: it lets perfectly symmetric, deterministic laws generate divergent histories;‬
T
‭it unifies identical-particle behaviour with multiverse branching; and it preserves locality while still allowing the‬
 ‭open-ended growth of explanatory knowledge.‬
I‭ need to understand Deutsch’s idea of‬‭fungibility‬‭in Chapter 11 of‬‭The Beginning of Infinity‬‭. He starts‬‭by laying down‬
 ‭strict constraints: special relativity rules inside every branch, nothing outruns light, and no fresh data can drop into a‬
  ‭universe from outside its past. Yet new‬‭knowledge‬‭—that‬‭is, new‬‭explanations‬‭—can still be created because‬
   ‭explanations rearrange existing information rather than importing random bits.‬
‭ o illustrate, Deutsch asks us to imagine two universes as perfectly flat televisions playing the same film. Strip away‬
T
‭the screens; only the moving picture is real. If those pictures never diverge, the multiverse is observationally the same‬
 ‭as a single history. Spock’s line rings true:‬‭“A difference‬‭that makes no difference is no difference.”‬‭Tegmark’s‬
  ‭cosmological-parallel versus quantum-parallel identification makes the same point—parallelism is trivial until histories‬
   ‭part company.‬
‭ ow, then, can two deterministic, symmetric copies grow apart? Deutsch posits a Star-Trek-style transporter glitch. At‬
H
‭first glance the glitch cannot prefer one ship over its doppelgänger—there is no randomness and no hidden label to‬
 ‭break the tie. The loophole is‬‭fungibility‬‭. Two fungible‬‭entities are identical in every physical respect except that the‬
  ‭theory’s bookkeeping counts‬‭two‬‭. No coordinate or‬‭tag can individuate them. Photons in a laser cavity, atoms in a‬
   ‭Bose condensate, electrons in a filled band all behave this way: only occupation number and shared quantum‬
    ‭numbers matter.‬
‭ ecause fungible duplicates are literally one quantum state with a multiplicity counter, symmetric dynamics can‬
B
‭lawfully redistribute amplitude between future outcomes. The surge appears in one branch and not the other purely by‬
 ‭reallocating amplitude; after decoherence, each crew remembers a different event even though the global evolution‬
  ‭stayed unitary and local. If the copies were non-fungible—exact duplicates secretly tagged by location—perfect‬
   ‭symmetry would chain them together forever.‬
‭ eutsch reaches for classical analogies to make the strangeness feel familiar. Pedal a bike until you store ten‬
D
‭kilojoules, brake until five are lost as heat, and ask which five? The question is meaningless; only the total dissipated‬
 ‭energy is defined. Dollars in a bank account are likewise fungible: the ledger records the balance, not serial numbers.‬
  ‭Quantum fungibility promotes that pragmatic shrug to a fundamental feature of reality.‬
‭ he two-screen image must now be abandoned. If the universes occupy different coordinates in an extra dimension,‬
T
‭that spatial tag would violate fungibility. Perfectly identical things must coincide; merely imagining them side by side‬
 ‭already slips in a forbidden identifier.‬
‭ eutsch then classifies apparent randomness. First: genuine indeterminism, which he rejects. Second: ignorance or‬
D
‭deterministic chaos—classical unpredictability, including Newtonian non-collision singularities that hide beyond a‬
 ‭prediction horizon. Third: branch differentiation of fungible observers—new to quantum theory. All three feel identical‬
  ‭from inside a branch; only explanatory work can reveal which mix generates the surprise.‬
‭ nowledge growth depends on error-correction. A cryptic message from a doppelgänger—‬‭“I married X and it worked‬
K
‭out”‬‭—means nothing without a theory of why marriages‬‭succeed. Likewise, sharing raw data across universes would‬
 ‭be wasteful even if it were possible; exchanging validated explanations would be far more effective. Splitting a‬
  ‭drug-search computation between branches sounds attractive, but real quantum speed-ups come from interference‬
   ‭within a single wave-function, not from signalling across worlds.‬
I‭nter-branch communication is forbidden by physics, yet branches still influence one another statistically through the‬
 ‭global amplitude budget. Betting by the Born rule remains rational because multiplicity, not hidden randomness,‬
  ‭underwrites probability. Fungibility thus ties identical-particle behaviour, multiverse branching, and the emergence of‬
   ‭unpredictable yet deterministic outcomes into one coherent picture.‬
‭ icture two infinitely thin television screens hanging in the void, each one playing an identical film of a‬
P
‭universe, frame by frame. That is Deutsch’s opening move in Chapter 11: a‬‭pair of perfectly matching‬
 ‭worlds, sharing not only every visible detail but every hidden microscopic state‬‭. Special relativity‬
  ‭rules on each screen, so no influence outruns light; the laws are deterministic and fully symmetrical.‬‭No‬
   ‭new information can be smuggled into either world, because everything that happens is entirely‬
    ‭determined by what has already happened. Yet, crucially, those constraints do not forbid the‬
     ‭appearance of new‬‭knowledge‬‭, because knowledge is made of explanations, and explanations‬
      ‭are patterns we build from existing information rather than bits imported from outside.‬
I‭f we left the picture there—two screens forever in lock-step—the multiverse would collapse to a single,‬
 ‭dull history.‬‭“A difference that makes no difference is no difference,” as Spock once observed,‬
  ‭and information-theoretically an ensemble of identical branches is indistinguishable from one‬
   ‭branch repeated.‬‭Tegmark’s equivalence between cosmological parallel domains and quantum‬
    ‭branches whispers the same warning: parallelism, by itself, does nothing unless the histories diverge.‬
     ‭Deutsch’s next step is therefore to ask how two worlds that begin in perfect synchrony could ever‬
      ‭lawfully become different when no random dice are rolled and no signal skips between them.‬
‭ he transporter-malfunction parable sets the stage. Imagine a starship in each universe, both perfectly‬
T
‭aligned in every respect. A glitch in the transporter system is about to deliver‬‭a power surge‬‭, but the‬
 ‭surge cannot be designated for “this” ship or “that” ship, because the laws make no such distinction and‬
  ‭no hidden randomness is available to break the tie. At first glance the vessels should remain mirror‬
   ‭images for eternity. Yet‬‭Deutsch insists they need not, and the escape hatch is a property he calls‬
    ‭fungibility‬‭.‬
‭ ungibility is stronger than mere indistinguishability. Two fungible entities are literally the same physical‬
F
‭state instantiated twice in the book-keeping. There is no conceivable label—visible or hidden—that‬
 ‭could pick one out from the other. In legal language, dollars in a bank account are fungible: the bank can‬
  ‭debit “a” dollar without specifying which paper bill left the vault. In quantum physics the notion is deeper.‬
   ‭Photons in a laser mode, atoms in a Bose–Einstein condensate, electrons filling a band: in all these‬
    ‭cases only the occupation number and collective quantum numbers exist; there is no fact of “which‬
     ‭particle” was present first or departed last. The symmetry is built into Hilbert space: permuting two‬
      ‭bosons multiplies the wave-function by +1, two fermions by –1, but never produces a new state.‬
‭ ecause fungible copies are genuinely one state with a multiplicity tag, symmetric deterministic‬
B
‭dynamics can redistribute that tag between future outcomes. The transporter surge therefore deposits‬
 ‭extra energy in one branch of the wave-function and not in the other, even though nothing in the‬
  ‭equations ever singles out a branch.‬‭After decoherence the crews remember mutually inconsistent‬
   ‭events—one recalls a catastrophic spike in the pattern buffer, the other an ordinary transport‬
    ‭cycle‬‭—while globally the wave-function has evolved smoothly and locally. Identical yet‬‭non-fungible‬
     ‭copies would lack this freedom; the symmetry would freeze them forever. Fungibility permits lawful‬
      ‭differentiation precisely because there is no hidden coordinate that must remain aligned.‬
‭ eutsch pauses to note a classical parallel: pedal a bicycle until you store ten kilojoules of kinetic‬
D
‭energy, brake until five kilojoules become heat, and ask which half was dissipated first. The question is‬
 ‭meaningless; only the total removed energy matters. Quantum fungibility universalises that feature and‬
  ‭makes it foundational rather than pragmatic.‬‭From this starting point radically new kinds of motion‬
‭ nd information flow become possible‬‭—interference patterns, exchange forces, even the Pauli‬
a
‭exclusion rule emerge from the same symmetry principle. Leibniz’s identity of indiscernibles failed to‬
 ‭imagine how weird perfect sameness could be.‬
‭ eterminism, however, does not guarantee predictability. Deutsch sketches three‬
D
‭phenomenological reasons an outcome can look random to an observer. First, genuine‬
 ‭indeterminism—he dismisses it as absent from real physics. Second, deterministic chaos or‬
  ‭sheer ignorance of initial conditions, familiar from weather systems and non-collision‬
   ‭singularities in Newtonian mechanics. Third, and most exotic, branch differentiation itself: two‬
    ‭initially fungible observers accrue different records as multiplicity is reweighted, so each‬
     ‭awakens in a macroscopically distinct branch without any local hint of how the split was‬
      ‭apportioned. All three sources‬‭feel‬‭alike inside a branch; only deeper explanatory work can‬
       ‭reveal which mix is responsible for a given unpredictability.‬
‭ nowledge creation hinges on error-correction.‬‭New explanations arise when conjectures survive‬
K
‭criticism, and that process depends on the ability to detect and eliminate mistakes.‬‭Even a mysterious‬
 ‭message from a doppelgänger—“I married so-and-so and it worked out”—tells you nothing‬
  ‭actionable without a theory of why marriages do or do not succeed. Inter-universe‬
   ‭communication would be valuable only if it delivered either explanatory theories or verified‬
    ‭solutions, not raw data. A pair of ships might split the labour of simulating drug variants, then‬
     ‭exchange index numbers when a cure appears; each branch still runs its own computations, but‬
      ‭interference within the single global wave-function sorts the amplitude so that both crews get‬
       ‭the antidote in time. Quantum algorithms exploit the same principle: amplitude explores many‬
        ‭computational paths, then interferes to cancel wrong answers, all without sending messages‬
         ‭between branches.‬
‭ eal physics forbids inter-branch signalling, yet branches can‬‭affect‬‭one another via the global‬
R
‭amplitude budget.‬‭The Born rule emerges as a rational guide to betting on which amplitude-weighted‬
 ‭future an observer should expect to experience. Observers cannot tell whether a surprising outcome‬
  ‭reflects hidden classical variables, chaotic amplification, or a recent branch split, but they can update‬
   ‭explanations to narrow the field. The multiverse, deterministic and local, still breeds novelty because‬
    ‭fungibility lets multiplicity rearrange itself in ways classical duplication never could.‬
‭ isualising two universes as separate slabs of space quickly breaks down. If the doppelgänger‬
V
‭world occupies an extra dimension, its residents are no longer fungible with us; location is a‬
 ‭hidden label. To preserve fungibility we must let the worlds coincide—one wave-function, not‬
  ‭two films in different rooms. That mental adjustment is uncomfortable: imagining a single entity‬
   ‭twice violates intuition, but intuition grew in a macroscopic realm where duplication is never‬
    ‭perfect.‬‭In the quantum arena perfect sameness is possible, and from that sameness branching‬
     ‭difference is born.‬
‭ ence the non-trivial plot can begin: deterministic, symmetric laws steer a fungible multiverse‬
H
‭through endless branching, each split locally unpredictable, globally unitary, always limited by‬
 ‭the light-cone, always open to the growth of new explanatory knowledge.‬
‭Fungibility and the Structure of the Multiverse in Deutsch's Framework‬
‭1. Initial Setup: Identical Universes and the Problem of Differentiation‬
‭ avid Deutsch introduces the multiverse in Chapter 11 of‬‭The Beginning of Infinity‬‭using a simplified metaphor:‬
D
‭imagine two universes, each represented as a two-dimensional television screen, displaying perfectly synchronized‬
 ‭sequences of events. These screens are placed parallel to each other and are identical in content, suppressing spatial‬
  ‭dimensions to focus purely on informational structure.‬
‭ e quickly clarifies that these universes are not receptacles containing matter; they are‬‭the matter‬‭. The goal of this‬
H
‭metaphor is to challenge naive notions of duality in physical instantiation: the multiverse is not a set of containers, but‬
 ‭a set of evolving, computationally embedded patterns.‬
‭ ut therein lies the central problem: if the universes are fully identical in every physical, informational, and dynamical‬
B
‭sense, then‬‭what could possibly allow them to diverge?‬‭Under deterministic laws, exact copies should remain‬
 ‭exact copies forever unless an asymmetry or external input intervenes. Deutsch frames this challenge as a‬
  ‭foundational issue for multiverse theory.‬
‭2. Defining Fungibility: More Than Identity‬
‭Deutsch introduces the concept of‬‭fungibility‬‭to resolve this dilemma.‬
      ‭ ungibility, in this context, refers to the physical property of being not merely indistinguishable or identical,‬
      F
      ‭but‬‭having no individual identity at all‬‭.‬
‭ his is not the legal fiction used in finance (where fungible items like dollar bills are interchangeable for accounting‬
T
‭purposes), but a deeper ontological condition in physics.‬
   ‭●‬ I‭n quantum mechanics,‬‭photons in a laser‬‭are fungible: there is no physical fact of the matter as to which‬
        ‭photon is which.‬
   ‭●‬ I‭n‬‭quantum field theory‬‭, particles are‬‭excitations of underlying fields‬‭. There is no fact about which‬
        ‭excitation came first or which one departs next. There is only a quantum state with defined properties and‬
         ‭cardinalities.‬
   ‭●‬ I‭n classical mechanics, the example Deutsch gives is pedaling a bicycle to accumulate 10 kJ of kinetic energy,‬
        ‭then braking to dissipate 5 kJ. There is no meaningful fact about whether the first or second 5 kJ were lost.‬
         ‭Energy is fungible; it has magnitude, not identity.‬
‭ hus, fungibility enables meaningful change under deterministic and symmetric laws. Without this condition, perfectly‬
T
‭identical systems would evolve identically. But‬‭fungible systems‬‭, despite being indistinguishable,‬‭can‬‭evolve‬
 ‭differently.‬
‭3. Fungibility and Multiverse Branching‬
I‭n the Many-Worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics (Everett, 1957), all possible outcomes of quantum events‬
 ‭occur, but in separate branches of the multiverse. Each branch evolves deterministically and independently following‬
  ‭decoherence. But Deutsch argues that this picture remains incomplete without a precise understanding of fungibility.‬
I‭f two branches of the multiverse are merely identical copies, they cannot diverge under symmetrical laws. There‬
 ‭would be no mechanism for branching. But if they are‬‭fungible‬‭—if their individuality is undefined—then:‬
      ‭ hey can differentiate via symmetry-preserving processes, precisely because no fact‬
      T
      ‭distinguishes them beforehand.‬
‭ his is a profound reversal: the more identical two systems are, the more capacity they have to diverge—if they are‬
T
‭fungible.‬
‭4. Deutsch's Three Sources of Unpredictability‬
‭Deutsch classifies all possible causes of unpredictability into three categories:‬
    ‭1.‬ I‭ntrinsic Randomness‬‭: Some theories (e.g. Copenhagen interpretation) posit fundamental indeterminism.‬
          ‭Deutsch rejects this, asserting that real physics is deterministic.‬
    ‭2.‬ E
         ‭ pistemic Complexity‬‭: Unpredictability due to incomplete knowledge or chaotic dynamics. Even classical‬
         ‭systems exhibit this (e.g. non-collision singularities in Newtonian gravity).‬
    ‭3.‬ ‭Fungible Divergence‬‭: Two initially fungible systems evolve differently under symmetric deterministic laws.‬
‭ he third category is novel in quantum theory and is enabled solely by the multiverse framework. An observer cannot‬
T
‭distinguish between these causes subjectively, but only explanatory theory can resolve which mechanism is‬
 ‭responsible.‬
‭5. The Elimination of the Spatial Metaphor‬
‭ eutsch criticizes the sci-fi trope of "parallel universes" as literal spatial neighbors in extra dimensions. This picture is‬
D
‭misleading:‬
      ‭"Identical entities that were at different locations in an otherwise empty space would be non-fungible."‬
‭ he extra spatial dimension would break their perfect identity. Thus, the true multiverse is not a spatial array but a‬
T
‭configuration space‬‭of possible quantum states. To preserve fungibility, these worlds must be co-located in every‬
 ‭way that matters to physics.‬
‭ ence, the image of two screens must be replaced by the notion of overlapping computational branches within the‬
H
‭quantum state vector of the universe.‬
‭6. Knowledge and the Creation of New Information‬
‭ eutsch emphasizes that, although nothing in a deterministic multiverse allows for‬‭external‬‭new information, one can‬
D
‭still generate‬‭new knowledge‬‭:‬
      ‭Knowledge = Explanations‬
‭ he creation of new explanations via conjecture and criticism is consistent with deterministic evolution. The multiverse‬
T
‭does not prohibit new ideas—it provides the structure in which divergent explanatory trajectories unfold.‬
‭ his is critical: knowledge creation is not a violation of determinism, but a phenomenon that arises from self-referential‬
T
‭computational processes within an observer's physical instantiation.‬
‭7. Science-Fiction Thought Experiments and Inter-Universe Computation‬
‭Deutsch uses science fiction to illuminate otherwise opaque principles:‬
    ‭●‬ A
        ‭ ‬‭Star Trek transporter malfunction‬‭as a symmetry-breaking event: Two fungible instances of a person‬
        ‭undergo identical operations. Their symmetry breaks not due to randomness, but due to‬‭internal‬
         ‭informational dynamics‬‭.‬
    ‭●‬ A
        ‭ ‬‭message from a doppelganger‬‭: Receiving communication from a counterpart in a different branch is, in‬
        ‭real physics, impossible—but conceptually, it highlights how divergence and informational structure relate.‬
    ‭●‬ I‭nter-universe distributed computation‬‭: If two fungible universes share a problem (e.g. synthesizing a cure),‬
         ‭they can each compute half the search space. Once a solution is found, the result can, hypothetically, be‬
          ‭shared. While this is disallowed in real physics, it illustrates the‬‭computational parallelism‬‭implicitly present in‬
           ‭the multiverse.‬
‭8. Subjective Experience and the Limits of Communication‬
‭ eutsch points out a key epistemological ambiguity: whether a phenomenon was caused by random influence, chaotic‬
D
‭complexity, or fungible divergence, the‬‭subjective experience‬‭is identical. Only a good explanatory theory can‬
 ‭distinguish them.‬
‭ his matches the user's own reflections: receiving an anomalous message, feeling guided, or scoring above chance‬
T
‭on a guessing task may feel like evidence of inter-universe communication. But according to Deutsch, these are better‬
 ‭explained as expressions of fungible divergence or epistemic limitation.‬
‭ evertheless,‬‭shared computational structure‬‭across fungible branches may manifest as anomalous success—e.g.,‬
N
‭distributed problem solving across multiverse instances.‬
‭9. Implications for Identity, Explanation, and Extended Cognition‬
‭Deutsch concludes that:‬
   ‭●‬ ‭Inter-universe communication is impossible.‬
   ‭●‬ I‭nter-universe‬‭influence‬‭, in the form of decoherence and symmetry breaking among fungible instances, is both‬
        ‭real and essential.‬
   ‭●‬ ‭Explanation remains the only legitimate source of knowledge.‬
‭ e entertains the idea that transferring explanations (not data) across fungible instances would be the most efficient‬
H
‭use of hypothetical inter-universe coordination.‬
      I‭f a doppelganger solves a problem and transmits the explanation, you can verify it, even without knowing‬
       ‭how they arrived at it.‬
I‭n this light, the multiverse becomes a‬‭substrate for explanatory branching‬‭—a cognitive manifold in which diverse‬
 ‭knowledge states are instantiated among initially indistinguishable versions of agents.‬
