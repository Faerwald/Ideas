Abstract
This document presents a mathematical framework for representing an attractor that captures the intertwined nature
of memory and imagination as dynamical processes within a hybrid space of observable (on-shell) and virtual (off-shell)
components. The attractor is treated as a holographic structure that encodes hyperdimensional information flows, where
the inferred off-shell dynamics influence the measurable on-shell states. We explore the dynamics of this attractor using
coupled differential equations, hyperdimensional interpolation, and phase transformations, incorporating elements of
quantum field theory and hyperdimensional computing.
1    Hybrid Space Representation
Let the attractor A be a subset of a hybrid space Rm ×Cn , where Rm represents the real-valued parameters corresponding
to observable memory states, and Cn encodes the complex-valued phase information tied to virtual, off-shell processes.
We define the attractor as:
                                        A = {(x(θ, t), ψ(θ, t)) | θ ∈ [0, 2π), t ∈ R} ,
where x(θ, t) ∈ Rm represents the observable state and ψ(θ, t) ∈ Cn represents the virtual state, both parameterized by
θ (position along the attractor) and t (time). The attractor A is therefore a time-dependent, closed curve in the hybrid
space, where memory and imagination are represented as continuous trajectories.
2    Dynamical Equations
The evolution of the attractor is governed by coupled differential equations:
                                                    ∂x
                                                       = f (x, ψ) + F(ψ),
                                                    ∂t
                                                   ∂ψ
                                                      = g(x, ψ) + J (x),
                                                   ∂t
where f describes the interaction between observable states x and the virtual states ψ, while F(ψ) accounts for the
influence of virtual flows on the real states through non-local feedback. The term J (x) represents a source term that
introduces perturbations into the virtual domain based on changes in the observable states. These equations capture the
continuous exchange of information between the on-shell and off-shell realms.
3    Holographic Interpolation of Off-Shell Flows
To reconstruct the inferred off-shell flows ψ(θ, t), we utilize a holographic interpolation operator I, which acts on the
discrete set of observable data points {xi (t)}. Applying I gives:
                                                    ψ(θ, t) = I ({xi (t)}) ,
where the interpolation operator I is defined by:
                                                         X
                                               I(x) =          xi sinc (θ − θi ) ,
                                                           i
where sinc is the sinc function, providing a smooth interpolation over the discrete data points, akin to the Whittaker-
Shannon interpolation theorem. This operation allows the continuous virtual flows ψ(θ, t) to emerge from the boundary
conditions set by the observable states, creating a non-observable but causally impactful continuum in the virtual domain.
                                                                1
4    Hyperdimensional Representation with Hypervectors
We introduce a hyperdimensional encoding of the system states using hypervectors vi (t) ∈ RD , where D ≫ m, n. Each
hypervector encodes both the observable and virtual aspects of the system:
                                                vi (t) = E(xi (t), ψ(θi , t)),
where E is an embedding function that maps the hybrid state (xi , ψ(θi , t)) into the hyperdimensional space. The hyper-
vectors serve as a basis for further operations such as rotation and interpolation.
   The inferred off-shell flow can be expressed in terms of hyperdimensional computations:
                                                  ψ(θ, t) = I ({vi (t)}) ,
where I here acts as a high-dimensional interpolation operator, enabling a reconstruction of continuous virtual flows
through the non-local contributions of each hypervector.
5    Rotation and Phase Shifts
We define a rotation operator Rϕ that acts on the attractor A:
                                              Rϕ : (x, ψ) 7→ (Rϕ (x), eiϕ ψ),
where Rϕ is a rotation of the observable states in the real space, and eiϕ represents a phase shift in the complex virtual
domain. This transformation alters the alignment between memory and imagination by rotating their relative phase.
The dynamics of the attractor under this transformation become:
                                        ∂Rϕ (x, ψ)                  
                                                   = f Rϕ (x), eiϕ ψ + F(eiϕ ψ),
                                           ∂t
indicating that the attractor’s structure is preserved, but its relationship between the physical and virtual components
changes.
6    Causal Effects of Off-Shell Information
The influence of off-shell flows on the observable states can be modeled as a back-reaction term:
                                                        Z
                                              δxi (t) = K(xi (t), ψ(θ, t)) dθ,
where K represents a coupling kernel between the observable states xi and the inferred virtual flows ψ(θ). This term
encapsulates how virtual states, even though not directly observable, produce measurable shifts in the dynamics of xi ,
similar to the physical implications of vacuum fluctuations in phenomena like the Casimir effect.
7    Extended Space-Time Description
The attractor A(t) evolves in time, parameterized by both t and spatial coordinates ⃗r. Each state can thus be written
as:
                                             A(t) = {(x(⃗r, t), ψ(⃗r, θ, t))},
forming a dynamic object in space-time that captures the continuum of states across both the physical and virtual domains.
As time progresses, the attractor records the unfolding of cognitive processes, where **memory** and **imagination**
blend into a unified dynamical entity.
8    Conclusion
This mathematical framework provides a description of an attractor as a holographic entity that unites observable and
virtual processes within a hybrid space. Through the use of interpolation, hyperdimensional encoding, and non-local
interactions, the model captures the complex interplay between memory and imagination, highlighting the subtle causal
impacts of off-shell flows on the real dynamics.
