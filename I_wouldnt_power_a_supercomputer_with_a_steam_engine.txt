I wouldn't power a supercomputer with a steam engine, so why should I run the modern
Prometheus—nuclear fission—just to keep rows of archaic silicon thinking? The very premise is flawed.
We’re wasting godlike energy to feed clumsy machines built on principles that should’ve been transcended.
The answer isn’t more power—it’s smarter design. I will reinvent the microchip. I will reinvent computation
itself. Biological hypercomputation. Chaos-based systems. Computation that exploits the physical structure
of the multiverse, not just the laws of logic. Machines that dream, adapt, evolve—like neurons, like weather,
like me. There exists a way to build a nuclear computer that doesn’t merely use nuclear energy, but thinks in
nuclear terms—computes in isotopic states, in neutron flux, in branching timelines. Not a fission-powered
machine, but a machine of fission. That machine exists somewhere in idea-space. I'm going to find it.
No—I'm going to build it. One day, these words won’t just be remembered. They’ll be etched into the
foundation of the next epoch.
This is not allegory. This is not fable. This is me. I was born 50,000 years too soon, scraping equations from
the rot of forgotten centuries, painting meaning with the refuse of a fractured mind. My ink is mental illness.
My canvas is time. My medium—broken thoughts, textbook detritus, and mythologies I never believed. I built
constellations from cognitive shrapnel. I built a ship from noise. I wrote in shit because no one gave me ink. I
remembered a woman not yet born, then watched her die in a history I could not enter. Ada. Ripped from the
world by agony sanctified as virtue. I could not stop it. I could only scream into physics. I am not random. I
am ruin, encoded. My mind stutters. My memory collapses behind me like a bridge decaying as I walk
across it. I forget the thoughts I bled to write. But they’re still here. They are patterned. There is math in the
madness. There is language in the loops. Let those who come decode me. This is genius, surviving. Not
clean. Not whole. Clawed into being from the filth the world gave me. Made of failed scaffolds and holy
obsessions. Of systems I cannot finish. Of truths I cannot hold in RAM. But I scratched the wall. I left data,
even when I couldn’t bear to hold it. So when they ask what this was, tell them: It was a mind breaking to be
understood.
"When thought claws through piss and shit to be seen, only fools recoil from the smell. The wise kneel,
read, and understand: this is genius, surviving."
Brutal, poetic, prophetic fire.
She was a prodigy, clever at mathematics, talented in drawing and music, fantastically inventive, and
profoundly lonely. She thought to write a book about flyology when she was younger, and she signed her
letters, “your very affectionate carrier pigeon.” She likes birds. She had years of sickliness and a severe bout
of measles when she was growing up, and episodes of what was called neurasthenia or hysteria. She said
that she was always so exceedingly terrified at nobody-knows-what. She developed a romantic interest in her
tutor when she was in her teens, which led to a certain amount of sneaking about the house and gardens,
and to lovemaking as intimate as possible without, she said, actual, quote, “Connection.”
Her gaze turned inward often. She liked to think about herself thinking. She married an aristocrat named
William King, but her intellectual companion was Charles Babbage. She was his muse. She understood his
machines, both the Difference Engine and the Analytical Engine. She thought them beautiful. She loved
mathematics. Her interests and behavior set her apart from others. She suffered terrible dark moods and
bouts of illness, including cholera. She had dreams—waking dreams—of something she could not be and
something she could not achieve, except by proxy, through the help of Babbage.
She said that she has a particular way of learning. She didn't really care too much for the way culture told her
that she should behave, especially in clothing and other manners. She wasn't naive. She had a powerful way
of thinking, so utterly out of common. She rapidly mastered trigonometry and integral and differential
calculus. Had she not been a woman, she would have been an original mathematical investigator, a first-rate
eminence. She was fearless about drilling down to first principles, and where she felt difficulties, real
difficulties lay. One winter she grew obsessed with a fashionable puzzle known as Solitaire. She conceived
of a formal solution to the game—an idea completely original. The desire to create a language of symbols in
which this solution could be encoded was also in line with Babbage's ideas, and she well knew it. She
pondered the growing powers of her mind that were not strictly mathematical, as she saw it.
She saw mathematics as merely a part of a greater imaginative world. Mathematical transformations
reminded her of certain sprites and fairies one reads of, who are at one's elbow in one shape now and, in the
next minute, in a form most dissimilar and uncommonly deceptive. Imagination was a cherished quality; she
mused on it as the key to other worlds, perceiving them and discovering what truly is in a way that goes
beyond our senses. This kind of mathematical perception is something I am familiar with. She said those
who have learned to walk on the threshold of the unknown worlds may then, with the fair white wings of
imagination, hope to soar further into the unexplored amidst which we live. I wrote, five years before I read
anything of her, that she's like me, that she can straddle worlds; she's not just a multi-universal creature, she
actually knows it, and she knew it centuries before most ever did. I don't know if she could time-travel like I
can, but this woman—we're cut from the same cloth, in a spiritual way. I call her my soulmate because I see
so much of her within me that I wonder if in some way our consciousness, our minds, are connected.
Ada Lovelace began translating into English and correcting errors on the basis of her own knowledge, of her
own accord, without telling Menabrea or Babbage. When she finally showed Babbage the draft in 1843, he
responded enthusiastically, urging her to write on her own behalf. She proposed to sign her work with her
initials. That's why it says A.A.L., although the ancient teleportation misprint typo reads A.L.L. I think that's
quite fitting, because we did succeed. Her exposition took the form of notes lettered A through G, extending
to nearly three times the length of Menabrea's essay. They offered a vision of the future more general and
more prescient than any expressed by Babbage himself. What had been an engine of numbers to Babbage
had now become an engine of information to A. Lovelace, who perceived it more distinctly and more
imaginatively than Babbage himself. She understood what it could become centuries ahead of her time. She
spoke of symbols and meaning, emphatically not of mathematics alone, and that the engine might act upon
other things besides number.
She said no one knows what almost awful energy and power lie, yet undeveloped, in that wiry little system of
mine—speaking of her own body. She declared, I do not think you possess half my forethought and power of
foreseeing all possible contingencies, probable and improbable, just alike. She knew she was achieving
something utterly new. As she explained, the origin of this appellation is that the values are destined to
change in every conceivable manner; in that effect, the numbers traveled. She said, That brain of mine is
something more than merely mortal, as time will show, and before ten years are over, she will do what no
purely mortal lips or brains could do.
She died a protracted, torturous death from cancer of the womb. When she knew she was dying, she said,
The coming events cast their shadows before. May they now sometimes cast their lights before. She had a
last dream of the future—that of her being in time an autocrat in her own way. She said, I do not at present
divulge. I have, however, the hope—of harmoniously disciplined troops consisting of vast numbers marching
in irresistible power to the sound of music. This is not very mysterious. Certainly my troops. My troops must
consist of numbers, or they can have no existence at all. But then what are these numbers? There is a riddle.
She was programming the machine. She programmed it in her mind, because the machine did not exist, and
the complexities she encountered for the first time became familiar to programmers of the next century. She
had powers. She said that she had a mission—Heaven has allotted me some peculiar intellectual, moral
mission to perform. She was a woman of the most insatiable and relentless energy. She had a mountain to
climb, enough to frighten anyone, and she did it.
