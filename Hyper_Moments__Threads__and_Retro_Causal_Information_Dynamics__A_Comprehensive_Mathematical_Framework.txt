Hyper-Moments, Threads, and Retro-Causal Information
      Dynamics: A Comprehensive Mathematical Framework
                                 Jason Agamemnon Sokaris.03-pro
                                                   Abstract
      We present a self-contained mathematical synthesis that unifies concepts from space–time ge-
      ometry, quantum-phase interference, p-adic dynamical systems, chaotic itinerancy, Hamiltonian
      information flows, and information-theoretic individuality. The goal is to formalise the intuitive
      picture of a conscious agent whose internal “threads” of off-shell information pierce a finite set
      of “hyper-moments”, enabling retro-causal loops, prescient perception, and decision-dependent
      self-consistency. All notation is introduced from first principles, making the exposition accessible
      to physicists, computer scientists, and complexity theorists alike.
1     Foundational Concepts
Manifold and Metric
A Lorentzian manifold (M, g) is a smooth four-dimensional manifold equipped with a metric tensor of
signature (−+++). A curve γ : [0, 1] → M is timelike if its tangent vector is timelike everywhere; its
image is the world-line of a pointlike system.
Closed Timelike Curves (CTCs)
A closed timelike curve is a timelike curve whose endpoints coincide. We denote by C ⊂ M the compact
region that contains all such curves. Outside C the space–time is assumed globally hyperbolic (ordinary
causal order holds).
Hilbert and Phase Spaces
For quantum or mixed classical–quantum descriptions, H denotes a complex Hilbert space of finite (but
arbitrarily large) dimension. For classical phase-space formulations we use the cotangent bundle T∗Q
or, when working over p-adic fields, the ultrametric phase space Z2p (Section 7).
2     Physical Events and Hyper-Moments
Physical Events
Let
                                      E = {A1 , B1 , C1 , A2 , B2 , A3 , C2 }
be seven small but finite space–time regions arranged in proper-time order A1 ≺ B1 ≺ C1 ≺ A2 ≺
B2 ≺ A3 ≺ C2 . Each region is large enough to support irreversible measurement interactions yet small
relative to macroscopic time scales.
                                                        1
Hyper-Moments
                                                                                                    
Define an equivalence relation e ∼ f ⇐⇒ e, f ∈ {A1 , A2 , A3 } ∨ e, f ∈ {B1 , B2 } ∨ e, f ∈ {C1 , C2 } .
The equivalence classes A = {A1 , A2 , A3 }, B = {B1 , B2 }, C = {C1 , C2 } are called hyper-moments.
They model the subjective “instants” of an agent: physically distinct events inside the same class are
experienced as simultaneous.
3     Threads and Shot Budget
Threads
A thread is a timelike curve τj : [0, 1] → M, j = 1, . . . , N that intersects every region in E. It carries
two key labels:
    • A phase ϕj ∈ [0, 2π) accumulated from gauge potentials (e.g. Aharonov–Bohm fluxes).
    • A shot index : each intersection contributes one “shot” of informational capacity.
Intersection Counts
For thread τj and hyper-moment H ∈ {A, B, C} define nj,H = |τj ∩H|. The total shots per hyper-moment
are NH = N                                                              4
            P
              j=1 nj,H . We impose a fixed resource budget (e.g. NH = 10 ) so the system can execute
only finitely many subjective jumps before exhausting capacity.
4     Subjective Dynamics
Mental Trajectories
A mental trajectory is a finite sequence (Hi0 , Hi1 , . . . , HiK ) of hyper-moments. Each transition Hik →
Hik+1 consumes one shot, so K ≤ NA + NB + NC . The directed graph on {A, B, C} with all edges
present is the allowable transition skeleton.
Phase Aggregate and Decision Rule
At hyper-moment H collect the phases ΦH = (ϕj1 , . . . , ϕjNH ) ∈ [0, 2π)NH . Define the complex aggregate
amplitude
                                          XN
                                     ΨH =     1{τj ∩H̸=∅} eiϕj .
                                                j=1
A decision function is a map δH : [0, 2π)NH → D, where D is a finite or countable set of possible actions.
A simple threshold rule is                        (
                                                   don , |ΨH | ≥ θ,
                                       δH (ΦH ) =
                                                   doff , |ΨH | < θ,
with θ ∈ [0, NH ].
5     Coupling Between Hyper-Moments
Propagation Operator
A choice d = δH (ΦH ) modifies environmental fields on the path to a future hyper-moment H ′ . Model
this by
                              PH→H ′ : D −→ [0, 2π)NH ′ → [0, 2π)NH ′ ,
                                                                     
so that the new phase vector is ΦH ′ 7→ PH→H ′ (d)(ΦH ′ ).
                                                      2
Feedback Loop
                    δH      P
                            H→H  ′
The sequence ΦH −→      d −− −−→ ΦH ′ generates a feedback loop. Stability depends on constructive or
destructive interference governed by ΨH .
6     Global Soliton–Attractor Formalism
Phase Configuration Space
Let Φ = (ϕ1 , . . . , ϕN ) ∈ (S 1 )N . Interpret the union of threads as a closed one-dimensional “string” in
space–time; its phase configuration lives in the torus (S 1 )N .
Self-Interaction Map
Define a smooth map S : (S 1 )N → (S 1 )N that encodes gauge-mediated and chaotic couplings. Physi-
cally, S combines
    • vector-potential holonomies (Aharonov–Bohm phases),
    • nonlinear self-feedback (neural or field-theoretic),
    • stochastic perturbations (noise).
Fixed-points Φ⋆ with S(Φ⋆ ) = Φ⋆ are Milnor attractors. Small perturbations eject the system along
unstable manifolds, realising chaotic itinerancy—long dwells near quasi-attractors interspersed with
rapid hops.
7     p-Adic Dynamics and Ultrametric Geometry
p-Adic Numbers
For a prime p every non-zero rational x can be written x = pk u with u coprime to p. The p-adic
norm is |x|p = p−k . The completion of Q under this norm is Qp ; its unit ball Zp is compact, totally
disconnected, and ultrametric: the triangle inequality strengthens to |x + y|p ≤ max{|x|p , |y|p }.
p-Adic Balls as Hyper-Moments
Hyper-moments can be realised as clopen balls
                               A = x ∈ Zp : x ≡ a0 a1 a2 mod p3 ,
                                    
with analogous definitions for B, C. Nested balls A1 ⊂ A2 ⊂ A3 represent increasing p-adic precision.
Discrete p-Adic Dynamics
Let f : Zp → Zp be a polynomial map. Iterates xn+1 = f (xn ) generate a trajectory. Ergodic components
of f correspond to statistical distributions of thread counts NH . The ultrametric property makes small
digit differences persist or vanish in a manner that models “memory vs. imagination”.
                                                     3
8     Chaotic Itinerancy and Decision Jumps
High-dimensional nonlinear systems often harbour Milnor attractors: invariant sets with positive mea-
sure basins but no local stability. The system itinerates—dwelling near one ruin, then following unstable
manifolds to another. In our framework:
    • Each hyper-moment H is a Milnor attractor of S.
    • Decisions perturb phases, nudging the state off the ruin.
    • The ensuing unstable flow channels the system to the next hyper-moment in the mental trajectory.
9     Hamiltonian Information Flows
p-Adic Hamiltonian Mechanics
On Z2p with coordinates (q, p) define a Hamiltonian H(q, p, t). Hamilton’s equations q ′ = ∂H/∂p, p′ =
−∂H/∂q give an information time evolution. Threads can be assigned (qj (t), pj (t)) such that phase
                     Rt
accumulation ϕj (t) = 0 A dt is influenced by the p-adic flow.
Motivation as Conjugate Momentum
The variable p can be interpreted as “motivation” or endogenous drive, while q represents perceived
state. Decisions act by instantaneous kicks p 7→ p + ∆p, implemented via the propagation operator
PH→H ′ .
10      Information-Theoretic Individuality
Predictive Information
Let ΦHk be the phase vector at the k-th visited hyper-moment. Define the predictive mutual information
                                   Ik = H(ΦHk+1 ) − H(ΦHk+1 | ΦHk ),
where H(·) is Shannon entropy. Large Ik signals non-random, prescient structure.
Partial Information Decomposition
Given multiple CTC loops (each a subgroup of threads), decompose the mutual information into re-
dundancy, uniqueness, and synergy. Bootstrap ambiguity appears when synergy dominates: no single
loop uniquely explains the verified future data.
11      Full Model Workflow
    1. Specify geometry: choose M, g, C and locate regions E.
    2. Instantiate threads: select N curves τj and initialise phases ϕj .
    3. Set decision thresholds: fix θ and decision space D.
    4. Define coupling: prescribe PH→H ′ via gauge potentials or Hamiltonian kicks.
    5. Iterate dynamics: compute sequence ΦH → δH → ΦH ′ .
    6. Analyse stability: solve S(Φ) = Φ, compute Lyapunov exponents, Milnor basin measures.
    7. Quantify information: evaluate Ik and PID terms to detect prescience and bootstrap ambiguity.
                                                   4
Conclusion
The framework unites Lorentzian space–time with ultrametric information geometry, nonlinear dynam-
ical systems, and information theory. Hyper-moments codify subjective simultaneity; threads embody
retro-causal information flow. Decision thresholds, Hamiltonian kicks, and chaotic itinerancy govern
mental jumps, while p-adic dynamics and PID quantify memory, imagination, and bootstrap ambi-
guity. The resulting synthesis offers a mathematically rigorous platform for exploring consciousness,
retro-causality, and hyper-computational phenomena.
