Hypercomputation via Multiversal Attractors

I. Deutsch’s Claims: Interference Without Communica-
tion
David Deutsch’s formulation of the Many-Worlds Interpretation asserts three precise points:
  1. Quantum interference: Before decoherence, probability amplitudes from different branches
     superpose (e.g. double-slit, quantum erasure).
  2. No classical communication: After decoherence, branches are causally isolated—no infor-
     mation, signals, or messages can pass between them.
  3. No direct observation of other universes: Observers remain confined to their own branch;
     other branches contribute only to overall amplitude calculations, not accessible data.
II. Game Theory: Coordination Without Messaging
Game theory distinguishes coordination from communication:
   • Schelling points: Agents independently converge on salient solutions (e.g. meeting at
     Grand Central Station at noon) by predicting each other’s reasoning, not by exchanging
     messages.
   • Correlated equilibria: Shared randomness or external signals (e.g. a lightning strike)
     create coordination without causal signaling.
These examples demonstrate that structural priors or common knowledge enable alignment
without direct interaction.
III. Dynamical Systems: Attractors as Shared Structures
A dynamical system (X, Φt ) evolves states x ∈ X by Φt (x). An attractor A ⊂ X satisfies:
                                 ∀ x ∈ U (A) :       lim Φt (x) ∈ A,
                                                 t→∞
where U (A) is a neighbourhood of A. Types include fixed points, limit cycles, and strange
attractors. Key insight: If multiple agents (or branches) share similar evolution rules, each
trajectory may independently converge to the same attractor, serving as an implicit coordination
structure.
IV. Hypercomputation Concept
A hypercomputer solves tasks beyond Turing machines (e.g. the Halting Problem) by exploiting
infinite resources or non-classical models. Standard theory forbids this in a single Turing-limited
universe.

V. Proposal: Multiversal Attractors Enable Hypercompu-
tation
We posit:
   • There exists a space of informational attractors encoding high-complexity solutions (proofs,
     insights).
   • Each universe’s agent, evolving conceptually under rule Si (t + 1) = Fi (Si (t)), falls into the
     same attractor A:
                                        lim Si (t) → A ∀ i.
                                          t→∞
   • An individual agent perceives emerging solutions “by intuition,” having not performed the
     full computation locally.
Thus, the multiverse functions as a distributed solver; each branch contributes, and the shared
attractor yields the result.
VI. Physical and Symbolic Mechanisms
A. Quantum Phase Coupling
The Aharonov–Bohm effect shows phase shifts
                                                     I
                                              q
                                         ∆ϕ =            A·dl
                                              ℏ
depend on the vector potential A, not on local fields. This nonlocal phase biasing can “nudge”
quantum systems without energy exchange.
B. Symbolic Schelling Fields
By embedding highly salient symbols (names, diagrams, phrases) into cognition or culture, one
creates Schelling fields: structured informational landscapes that guide independent cognitive
trajectories toward the same attractor.
VII. Conclusion
   • Deutsch’s “no communication” remains intact: no signals cross branches.
   • Game theory and dynamical systems show coordination via shared structure.
   • Multiversal informational attractors provide a mechanism for hypercomputational-like re-
     sults.
   • Phase and symbolic scaffolding (quantum potentials, Schelling fields) supply the physical
     and cognitive implementation.
This framework respects unitarity and no-signaling while offering a rigorous path to distributed
emergence of super-Turing solutions.
