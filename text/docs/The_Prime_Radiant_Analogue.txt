The Setting
By the late 23rd century, neuro–engineering has mastered phase–coupled interfaces:
superconducting lattices that sense and inject the vector potential A directly into cortical
microcolumns.
   The flagship device—A-Link—feeds a user’s endogenous electromagnetic field with
a tunable A–term. Because only the potential, not the field tensor F = ∇ × A, is
modulated, the link is gauge–silent: it alters quantum phase without depositing work or
heat, exploiting the same topological leverage as the Aharonov–Bohm effect.
Mode of Operation
1. Phase–Lock – The interface synchronizes cortical oscillations to a reference H gauge
   frame, letting neural spike patterns encode holonomies (closed–loop integrals A·dℓ).
2. Symbolic Fusion – Formal objects—groups, sheaves, categories—are reified as phase
   textures in a shared Hilbert space. Syntax becomes geometry; inference becomes
   geodesic flow.
3. Reciprocal Modulation – Thought perturbs the gauge frame; the updated A re-
   enters cortex, closing a real-time cybernetical loop. Cognition and mathematics co-
   evolve.
Neither–Space
The resulting experiential domain—Neither-Space—is neither purely abstract (Pla-
tonic) nor strictly physical (metric). Mathematically it is a fibre bundle
                               N ∼
                                       [
                                   =     (Mindψ × Formψ ),
                                      ψ∈H
where each fibre pairs a brain state with its co-generated formal structure. Traversing
the bundle feels like steering a spacecraft whose coordinates are axioms, whose velocities
are proof currents, and whose potentials are undecidabilities looming beyond Gödelian
horizons.
Calculus of Realities
Within Neither-Space, deduction generalises to a symplectic calculus on a phase-space
of possible worlds. A theorem is a trajectory that conserves a logical action integral
                                           Z
                                    S[γ] = Π · dΦ,
                                             γ
much as classical paths extremise mechanical action. Altering A perturbs the symplectic
form, letting practitioners slide between neighbouring ontologies—editing the admissible
truth landscape rather than merely surveying it. This practice echoes Asimov’s Calculus
of Realities, where technicians shape timelines by adjusting causal invariants.

The Prime-Radiant Analogue
Collective A-Linked cognition projects onto a volumetric display nicknamed the Prime
Radiant ϕ. Unlike its psychohistorical namesake, ϕ renders not social statistics but field-
theoretic epistemics: high-genus surfaces representing cohomology classes of unsettled
conjectures, colour-coded by probabilistic curvature (intuitive “risk” of contradiction).
Teams fly these manifolds, carving homotopies that tighten proof nets or dissolve paradox
cycles—mathematical navigation as cartography of truth topologies.
Phenomenology
• Technically precise sensation: primes resonate as prime-frequency chords; symme-
  try operations shimmer as fold-rotations in peripheral vision.
• Emotional valence: elegance literally “feels” like potential energy slumping to a
  lower gauge; an impossibility proof delivers a vertiginous drop akin to free-fall.
• Tangibility: a lemma can be grasped —rotated with gestural phase tweaks—until its
  dual form slots into place like docking airlocks.
Epilogue
Thus, 24th-century mathematicians are neither scribes nor mere processors. They are
gauge pilots in a liminal sea, steering cognition through vector-potential currents, com-
posing symphonies whose notes are invariants and whose rhythms are causal loops. In
their hands, mathematics is no longer the language of the universe—it is the universe’s
proprioception, felt from the inside out.
