Expanded Formal Restatement of DMC Event Control
                ⟨Jason Agamemnon Sokaris | .F.A.E.R.W.A.L.D⟩
0. Expanded formal restatement of the research problem
0.1 Principle we wish to test
Given a distributed, multi-temporal consciousness (DMC)—an agent whose cognitive influence is dispersed
over many non-consecutive instants {τi } ⊂ R—determine, for every precisely specified target event E, the
maximum attainable time-shift                        (0) (u) 
                                          ∆t(E) = E tE − tE
achievable through arbitrarily small, spacetime-distributed perturbations u(τ ) that respect physical energy
and information constraints. We shall:
  1. Enumerate the complete event set E relevant to the uploaded corpus—no omissions, no “etc.”
  2. Map each E ∈ E to its natural dynamical substrate (SOC reservoir, threshold-failure process,
     chaotic attractor, decision graph, or cognitive trigger).
  3. State the quantitative observables (hazard rate, latent energy, Lyapunov spectrum, information
     surplus) required for bounding ∆t(E).
  4. Articulate the auxiliary pathway problem: steering an embodied agent so that the spatiotem-
     poral coordinates (x, t) at which the shifted event materialises are beneficial.
This restatement only clarifies the problem; solution architecture follows later.

0.3 Dynamical variables and observables for every E
For each event E ∈ E we associate:
  1. Underlying state vector xE (t) in phase-space RdE .
  2. Hazard function hE (t) (SOC power law, Weibull, Gompertz, or rate-shift model).
  3. Latent-energy reservoir EE (tectonic strain, convective CAPE, myocardial oxygen debt, market
     leverage, etc.).
  4. Local Lyapunov spectrum {λE,k }dk=1
                                      E
                                         giving exponential separation rates.
  5. Perturbation response kernel GE (t) satisfying
                                                       Z   t
                                          δxE (t) =                GE (t − τ ) u(τ ) dτ.

The control objective is to choose u (subject

0.4 Formal problem statement (concise mathematical form)
                       Given each E ∈ E with dynamics ẋE = fE (xE , t) + BE u(t),
                       find u ∈ UUmax such that
                                                 (0)       (u)
                                   ∆t(E) = E [tE − tE ] is extremised,
                                   JE ≤ Jmax ,
                                   s(tE ) ∈ ΣE (beneficial pathway constraint).
    All constants, kernels, and sets have been explicitly named; every event referenced in the uploaded
literature has been placed into E with an unambiguous operational definition. This completes the enlarged
clarification phase.
