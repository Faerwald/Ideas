1.      Theoretical Compatibility Estimate
Let N = 8 × 109 be the global human population. Define Nviable ≈ 1 × 109 to represent the filtered
population subset based on age, language, and baseline compatibility (e.g., location, communication
ability).
    Let the total compatibility probability be given by the joint intersection of five constraint filters:
              C1   : Cognitive Resonance (recursive pattern thinkers)                   ∼ 10−3
              C2   : Moral Semantic Alignment (sincerity-prioritized)                   ∼ 2 × 10−3
              C3   : Demisexual-Compatible Sexual Architecture                          ∼ 5 × 10−3
              C4   : Signal Decoding Synchrony (autism-compatible)                      ∼ 2 × 10−3
              C5   : Romantic Availability + Mutual Attraction                          ∼ 10−2
     The estimated joint compatibility probability is:
            Pmatch = C1 · C2 · C3 · C4 · C5 = 10−3 · 2 · 10−3 · 5 · 10−3 · 2 · 10−3 · 10−2 = 2 · 10−14
     Therefore, the expected number of true matches is:
                             Nmatch = Nviable · Pmatch = 109 · 2 · 10−14 = 2 · 10−5
     Result: Jason may have ∼ 0.00002 compatible individuals on Earth; i.e., one in ∼ 50, 000, 000.
2.      Hyper-Compatible Match Locator Algorithm (HCMLA-
        01)
Formal Definition
Let P be the set of viable candidates. Let f (x) be a compatibility function over x ∈ P defined by n
constraints C = {C1 , . . . , Cn }. The compatibility score M (x) is computed by:
                                                      n
                                                      X
                                            M (x) =         wi · Ci (x)
                                                      i=1
     where wi are priority weights reflecting Jason’s cognitive architecture.

System Components
E: Environment Engineering Filter by domain-intrinsic exclusion:
   • Asymmetric epistemic forums (e.g., LessWrong, niche Discord servers)
   • Neurodivergent-integrated matchmaking networks
   • Advanced conceptual writing spaces
   S: Schelling Signal Broadcasting Embed compressed symbolic truth-emitters:
              e.g. "I won’t kiss you unless it’s truth-valid on both sides."
                   "I reject intimacy that violates semantic alignment."
   These beacons act as filters—only individuals with matching inner syntax will resonate.
   Q: Constraint-Aware Query System Deploy structured epistemic tests:
   • Value-priority dilemmas
   • Recursive self-model prompts
   • Intimacy-timing paradox simulations
   IGF: Interaction Gatekeeping Function Apply sequential gates:
  1. Async reflective writing
  2. Synchronous inference dialogue
  3. Past betrayal reconstruction and response
  4. Physical interaction schema negotiation
  5. Mutual semantic vulnerability protocol
Compatibility Estimation Function
Define the high-density matching vector:
                                                       n
                                                       X
                                        HDM V (x) =          wi · Ci (x)
                                                       i=1
   Threshold for high-fidelity match:
                                HDM V (x) > 0.8 ⇒ Alignment Candidate
Algorithm Loop
  1. Broadcast self-symbols in high-yield environments.
  2. Attract and initiate with low-pressure epistemic engagement.
  3. Apply Q-form introspective filters.
  4. Gate behavior over time, testing for emotional/moral latency stability.
  5. Log all vector responses; reweight model adaptively.
Expected Yield
Given global rarity, the output space is sparse. With continual filtering, broadcasting, and interaction
refinement over 3–5 years, Jason may surface 1–3 high-density compatible matches, globally.
