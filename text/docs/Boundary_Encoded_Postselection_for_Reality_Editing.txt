Boundary-Encoded Postselection for Reality Editing
                                            August 15, 2025
                                                  Abstract
         We formalize a hypothetical technology that edits publicly realized history by bracketing a
     subject’s cognitive worldline with two stimulus-evoked neural “anchors” and then selecting, from
     among all intermediate histories consistent with those anchors, a single branch that optimizes
     an objective (e.g., minimizing what the subject can learn about the editor while maximizing the
     editor’s information gain). Operationally, a faceless “no-name tag” elicits distinctive, reproducible
     evoked potentials at the start and end of an interaction. These act as boundary conditions
     (B0 , B1 ) for a postselection apparatus—an “antenna”—which evaluates the ensemble of admissible
     microhistories and commits one branch to the public record. We give a precise operational model,
     an optimization-theoretic formalization over path spaces using both path integrals and maximum-
     caliber (path entropy) methods, and an information-theoretic analysis of what can and cannot be
     achieved under time-symmetric dynamics, pre-/post-selection, and consistency constraints known
     from quantum models of closed timelike curves and postselected teleportation. We further specify
     neurophysiological requirements for the anchors (SSVEP/P300-like codes), propose falsifiable
     signatures, and map the design onto existing formalisms: two-state-vector quantum mechanics,
     process-matrix frameworks with indefinite causal order, and optimal control (Pontryagin-style) on
     trajectory ensembles. Throughout, all equations are framed so that standard physics is recovered
     when the postselection resource is absent.
1    Operational Overview
Primitive. A boundary encoder is a stimulus that, when viewed, drives the subject’s cortex into
a high-dimensional, high-entropy evoked pattern B ∈ Rd that is (i) robustly reproducible for that
subject under controlled conditions, (ii) hard to counterfeit by arbitrary ambient scenes, and (iii)
spectrally and spatially distinctive (e.g., steady-state visually evoked potentials at chosen frequencies
with individualized topographies).
Protocol. Two presentations define one editing session:
1. Start anchor B0 . At time t0 , the tag is shown, writing B0 into cortex.
2. Open interval. Time evolves; many microhistories are a priori admissible.
3. End anchor B1 . At time t1 , the tag is shown again, writing B1 .
4. Postselection & commit. An antenna conditions on (B0 , B1 ) and selects a branch h from the
   admissible set H(B0 , B1 ) according to an objective O, then commits h as the realized public history;
   other branches remain counterfactual bookkeeping.
Phenomenology. Because the final anchor participates in selection, the subject retrospectively
experiences an interval that appears already consistent with the ending. Among admissible branches,
those carrying strong evidence about the editor are dominated by branches that reproduce gross outcomes
while suppressing decisive traces; thus the world accumulates hints, not fingerprints.

2     Mathematical Model of Boundary-Conditioned Selection
2.1     Path space and admissibility
Let Ω be the space of microhistories h : [t0 , t1 ] → X , where X is the joint state of (subject, environment,
instrumentation). Let Φ : Ω → Rd × Rd map a history to the pair of evoked patterns produced by the
tag at its two presentations. Define the admissible set
                                  H(B0 , B1 ) ≡ { h ∈ Ω : Φ(h) = (B0 , B1 ) }.                                  (1)
We assume H(B0 , B1 ) ̸= ∅ (consistency) and that the anchors are experimentally reproducible (repeatable
mapping Φ given controlled stimuli).
2.2     Two complementary weighting schemes
Quantum amplitude weighting (path integral). Assign each h an amplitude A[h] ∝ exp ℏi S[h] ,
                                                                                                          
with action S from an underlying Lagrangian on X . Conditioning on (B0 , B1 ) yields the pre-/post-selected
path weight
                                wQM (h | B0 , B1 ) ∝ |A[h]|2 δΦ(h),(B0 ,B1 ) .                          (2)
This is the time-symmetric (ABL/TSVF) picture: histories are evaluated relative to both initial and
final boundary data.
Maximum-caliber (path entropy) weighting. When a coarse-grained, stochastic description is
appropriate, define a prior over paths by maximizing path entropy subject to dynamical constraints
{Ck [h] = ck }:
                                             1     X             
                                  pCal (h) =   exp −     λk Ck [h] ,                           (3)
                                             Z        k
and then condition on (B0 , B1 ) to get pCal (h | B0 , B1 ) ∝ pCal (h) δΦ(h),(B0 ,B1 ) . This supplies a controlled,
inference-grade path ensemble compatible with the anchors.
2.3     Editor’s optimization and commitment
Let Y denote what the subject (and public record) retain about the editor after t1 ; let E denote the
editor’s internal data. The editor chooses a branch h to extremize
                                                                     O(h),(4)
                                           h = arg maxh∈H(B0 ,B1 )
with a canonical choice
                                   O(h) = I(E; h) − α I(Y; h) − β C(h),                                         (5)
where I(·; ·) is mutual information (information gain), α ≥ 0 weights secrecy, and C encodes physical
costs (energy, risk, constraint violations). The commitment map Commit : H → {public worldline}
then publishes h and discards others from the public branch.
Remarks.
• The data-processing inequality implies that once a low-information branch is committed, later classical
  post-processing cannot increase subject knowledge about the editor; secrecy is built at selection time,
  not recovered later.
• In a TSVF rendering, (B0 , B1 ) are the pre-/post-selection states; admissible h have nonzero amplitude
  given those boundary states; selection is a resource beyond bare quantum conditioning (see below).
                                                          2
2.4    Control-theoretic framing
Let x(t) be the (coarse-grained) state and u(t) hidden interventions. Consider the continuous-time
optimal-control proxy:
                                             
                               ẋ = f x, u, t ,     x(t0 ) ∈ X0 , x(t1 ) ∈ X1 ,
                                    Z t1
                                                                       
                            J[u] =       L x(t), u(t), t dt + Ψ x(t1 ) ,                        (6)
                                       t0
subject to Φ(x(t0 )) = B0 , Φ(x(t1 )) = B1 . Pontryagin’s maximum principle provides necessary conditions
for u(t) , and the hidden control is then chosen so that the realized trajectory x(t) matches a branch
h∈H(B0 ,B1 ) that optimizes O. This supplies a classical surrogate for the selection functional and is useful
for engineering analysis (sensitivity, costs, trade-offs).
3     Physics of the Selection Resource
3.1    Time-symmetric quantum conditioning
Pre-/post-selection (ABL rule) and the two-state-vector formalism (TSVF) rigorously treat ensembles
specified by initial and final data. In this baseline, we do not choose the middle; we only compute
conditional probabilities given both ends. The editor technology posits an additional selector that,
having access to the whole admissible ensemble, commits one branch according to O. Mathematically this
is an oracle that picks a particular h from a nonempty support; physically it would require mechanisms
akin to postselected quantum teleportation (P-CTCs) or an equivalent final-state projection that is not
generically available.
3.2    Two concrete implementations (hypothetical)
(i) Postselected teleportation (P-CTC) channel. Couple the subject-environment degrees of
freedom over [t0 , t1 ] to an ancilla such that, at t1 , a projection onto a maximally entangled state enacts
effective retrocorrelations (as in P-CTC models). The tags provide the conditioning endcaps. The
selection resource then filters for branches optimizing O while respecting causal-consistency constraints
(no paradoxical fixed-point failures).
(ii) Indefinite causal order/process matrices. Implement an effective process with no global
causal order across the interval, but with local quantum mechanics preserved. The tags fix local boundary
data; the process matrix plays the role of the antenna, weighting admissible operations and inducing an
acausal-looking but globally consistent selection of h.
Computational implications. Granting ideal postselection elevates computational power to PostBQP =
PP. This does not violate logical consistency but implies extreme computational leverage if the selection
resource is physically realizable at scale. Practical feasibility is then a question of how (and at what
cost) such postselection is instantiated without breaking thermodynamics or signaling constraints.
4     Neurophysiology of the Boundary Encoder
4.1    Design of anchors
SSVEP anchors. Use multiple-frequency/multiple-phase flicker (e.g., 8.57 Hz, 12 Hz, 15 Hz) with
subject-calibrated phases to yield line spectra at stimulus frequencies and harmonics over occipi-
tal/parietal sites. The anchor B is the concatenated spectral-topographical feature vector (Fourier
amplitudes/phases across electrodes and harmonics), which is highly reproducible intra-subject and
difficult to synthesize spuriously.
                                                      3
P300 anchors (optional). An oddball-evoked P300 waveform (positive deflection ∼300 ms) can be
layered in via rare-tag flashes within a frequent background, locking a time-domain signature to the tag
while retaining SSVEP spectral structure.
4.2    Statistical distinctiveness and reproducibility
Let X be the random EEG feature vector during tag presentation. Define subject-specific templates
µ(0) , µ(1) and covariances Σ(0) , Σ(1) for start/end tag designs. Require:
              (i) Intra-condition separability: P Maha(X, µ(j) , Σ(j) ) < τ ≥ 1 − ϵ, j ∈ {0, 1},
                                                                          
                                                                                                 (7)
            (ii) Inter-condition near-orthogonality: ⟨µ(0) , µ(1) ⟩ ≈ 0 after whitening,             (8)
                                                                      
            (iii) Ambient robustness: P ambient scenes trigger Bj ≤ δ.                               (9)
With SSVEP designs, (i)–(iii) are empirically achievable; P300 adds a time-domain lock that is hard to
counterfeit without the specific oddball schedule.
5     Information-Theoretic Analysis
5.1    Objectives
Let random variables be defined on the path space: H for the realized branch, Y for public/subject
records, and E for editor-internal records. Canonical objectives include:
                            Secrecy: min I(Y; Editor identity/details)                              (10)
                            Learning: max I(E; H)                                                   (11)
                            Stability: min Var[macroscopic outcomes | H].                           (12)
The selection rule can be posed as a constrained optimization over H(B0 , B1 ), e.g.,
                        n                  o
                    max I(E; h) − αI(Y; h)     s.t. D(h) ≤ Dmax , Cons(h) = true,                   (13)
                    h∈H
where D is a divergence/cost and Cons enforces quantum/thermodynamic consistency.
5.2    Limits from data processing
Once h is committed, any classical channel Y = g(h,N ) satisfies I(Y; ·) ≤ I(h;·) . Thus secrecy must be
engineered into the selection (choose a low-information branch), not achieved post hoc. Conversely, the
editor’s private data E can be augmented by retaining and analyzing the entire admissible ensemble
pre-commit; this asymmetry underlies “folklore without fingerprints.”
5.3    Posterior over histories and MaxCal connection
If the antenna does not select a single branch but instead draws from a Gibbs-like distribution p(h |
B0 , B1 ) ∝ exp(−β C(h)) over admissible paths, then the maximum-caliber solution gives the least-biased
ensemble consistent with constraints. Deterministic commit corresponds to the zero-temperature limit
β → ∞.
6     Consistency Constraints and No-Paradox Conditions
6.1    ABL/TSVF constraints
Only histories with nonzero amplitude given pre-/post-selection are admissible. Weak-value pathologies
are avoided by respecting the domain of applicability (weak coupling, nonvanishing denominators) when
interpreting intermediate conditioning.
                                                     4
6.2    CTC models
Deutsch CTCs enforce fixed points of a completely positive map; P-CTCs emulate time travel via
postselected teleportation. The name-tag editor behaves like a constrained P-CTC resource bounded by
anchor-consistency and physical cost.
6.3    Indefinite causal order
Process matrices allow correlations incompatible with a definite causal order while preserving local
quantum mechanics. The editor leverages such structure to effect acausal-feeling branch selection without
overt contradictions.
7     Testable and Falsifiable Signatures
1. Anchor reproducibility: Across sessions, B0 , B1 reproduce within tight tolerance; cross-subject
   confusion rates are near chance when classifiers are trained on individualized templates (SSVEP+P300
   hybrids).
2. Retro-anchoring asymmetry: Conditioning on the presence of a valid B1 increases the probability
   that intervening events lack high-information editor traces, relative to matched controls lacking the
   final anchor.
3. Branch-selection bias: In multi-camera/multi-sensor setups, the realized record preferentially
   follows low-editor-information branches among many physically possible ones; the bias grows with
   the “strength” of the postselection resource (if tunable).
8     Implementation Sketch (Assuming Feasibility)
8.1    Boundary encoder hardware
Minimal visible tag: a small e-ink or microLED badge with programmable flicker, phase coding, and
sparse oddball bursts; optical isolation to limit environmental leakage. Firmware enforces subject-specific
codes.
8.2    Antenna stack
A quantum subsystem prepared to enact either (i) postselected entangled projections at t1 (P-CTC-like)
or (ii) a process-matrix-engineered interaction with indefinite order across the interval. The antenna
stores and analyzes the full admissible ensemble (simulated or physically sampled) before commit.
8.3    Commit mechanics
Commit is a projection (literal or effective) onto a branch h that passes: (a) anchor consistency; (b)
secrecy/learning objective; (c) global constraints (energy, causality consistency, no-signaling in the
operational sense). Public artifacts outside h never materialize; private artifacts from noncommitted
branches remain internal to the antenna.
9     Gauge-Holonomy Analogy (Anchor as Closed-Loop Phase)
If one treats the tag as imprinting a holonomy on a cognitive gauge bundle, then the two anchors define
a closed loop γ in a representational manifold M. The memory-phase shift is a loop integral
                                                   I
                                            ∆φ =      A · dℓ,                                      (14)
                                                      γ
                                                    5
with A a notional connection one-form over M. This does not assert electromagnetic coupling in cortex;
it provides a compact way to state that only the global loop defined by the two anchors is operationally
relevant, much as in Aharonov–Bohm where only the enclosed flux matters. In ordinary physics (no
selection resource), this reduces to an innocuous reparametrization with no editing power.
10     Limitations and Bounds
Thermodynamic/complexity cost. Realizing reliable postselection is equivalent to conditioning on
exponentially rare outcomes; any physical implementation must pay exponential resources or exploit
structure. Unbounded editing power would imply implausible resource scaling.
No-signaling discipline. The construction as stated avoids superluminal signaling at the operational
level by committing a single branch and never allowing information about noncommitted branches to
leak to public records.
Domain of validity. The two-anchor mechanism presumes calibrated anchors with tight error bars;
noisy anchors enlarge H(B0 , B1 ) and degrade secrecy/learning trade-offs.
11     Worked Mini-Example (Symbolic)
Let the coarse-grained hidden dynamics be ẋ = f (x, u), with cost
                                    Z t1
                                                                  
                                J=       λIpriv (x, u) − αIpub (x) dt,
                                        t0
and boundary constraints g(x(t0 )) = B0 , g(x(t1 )) = B1 . Construct the Hamiltonian
                          H(x, u, λ, p) = λIpriv (x, u) − αIpub (x) + p⊤ f (x, u),
with costate ṗ = −∂x H, stationarity ∂u H = 0, and transversality p(t1 ) = ∂x Ψ. Solving these yields
u(t) and hence a candidate trajectory x(t) which corresponds to a branch h∈H(B0 ,B1 ) . In the quantum
weighting picture, this control solution approximates the saddle of the phase functional S[h] most
compatible with the objective.
12     Practical Recipe (Subject Side)
1. Calibrate two anchor tags B0 , B1 with individualized SSVEP/P300 codes until intra-session repro-
   ducibility exceeds a preset Mahalanobis threshold.
2. Record dense, timestamped, multi-sensor logs during sessions (to test bias predictions).
3. Analyze whether the presence of B1 correlates with systematic suppression of high-information editor
   traces relative to matched controls.
Note. Remove the selection resource and the model collapses to standard conditioning: anchors become
mere markers in a normal worldline and no editing occurs. The entire construction is thus cleanly nested
inside established physics when the extra resource is set to zero.
