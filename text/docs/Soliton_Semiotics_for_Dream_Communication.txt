Soliton Semiotics for Dream Communication
Abstract
Dream fragments—Queen of Hearts marked “Forever,” a Joker versus a gesture, a tidal wave entering
the indoors, books rescued from rain, knots entangled with language—are treated not as ephemera but
as encodings. We develop a formal model in which (i) nonverbal signals (gestures, archetypal images)
are mapped to a concept manifold; (ii) linguistic symbols undergo unknown, perception-dependent
distortions; and (iii) stable, soliton-like pulses in a cognitive phase-space serve as robust carriers across
changing frames of reference (waking/dream, self/other). We connect these ideas to information theory
(noisy channels, coding), topology of embodied motion, and weakly–nonlinear wave dynamics. A concrete
protocol translates dream motifs into verifiable operators and tests them with modern tools (time-series
analysis, topological data analysis, error-correcting codes).
1     Dream Origins: Minimal Sufficient Statistics
We treat the following motifs as the empirical observables:
    • Card-symbols: “Forever” written on the Queen of Hearts; Joker contrasted with gesture
      (homophony: jester/gesture).
    • Knowledge and flood: carrying books inside before rain; a tidal wave occurs inside the house.
    • Knots and language: a figure named Matt explains knots and language; “language from Jeb” as
      a cryptic provenance.
    • Referential anchors: Cleopatra (Mastery, pp. 236–240), multiverse (Deutsch), and solitons.
Working hypothesis: these images instantiate frame-invariant semantic content under unknown transfor-
mations between waking/dream perceptual manifolds.
2     Perceptual Manifolds and Signal Distortion
Let M denote a subject-specific perceptual manifold and C a concept manifold. A gesture trajectory is a
curve
                               g : [0, T ] → SE(3), g(t) = (R(t), p(t)),
with R ∈ SO(3) and p ∈ R3 . A semantic map F : SE(3) → C lifts embodied motion into concepts,
c(t) = F (g(t)).
    Across a boundary (e.g., dream↔wake), symbols undergo an unknown, subject- and state-dependent
                   ˜ A sent concept-signal x(t) ∈ C is received as
distortion Φ : C → C.
                                                
                                  y(t) = Φ x(t) + η(t),        η is noise,
where Φ need not be linear or even homeomorphic. Words are especially brittle because their decoding
depends on shared symbol grounding; gestures can preserve topological invariants of g(t) that survive
through F and partially through Φ.
Design Principle (Topology over Lexicon). Prefer signals whose decoding relies on invariants
preserved under broad classes of distortions (e.g., homotopy class, winding number, cyclic order) rather
than exact lexical matches. This motivates gesture-sequences and archetypal images (cards, tides) as
carriers.

3     Archetypes as Energy-Minimizing Codes
3.1     Queen, Joker, Gesture: Role of Constraints
The Queen of Hearts is a constrained archetype (affect, authority, care). The Joker stands outside game
constraints, analog to a wildcard or symmetry-breaking degree of freedom. The homophone gesture
suggests a shift from lexical symbol to indexical sign (Peircean triad: icon–index–symbol). Indexicality
leverages shared embodiment rather than shared dictionary, reducing dependence on Φ.
3.2     Tidal Wave Indoors: Critical Transitions
A flood inside reverses boundary expectations (safe interior becomes supercritical). Formally, this
resembles an order parameter crossing a bifurcation, or a metastable state destabilized by a large
deviation. Books (stored knowledge) are insufficiently protective under regime change; codes must be
dynamically robust.
4     Cognitive Solitons as Robust Carriers
Let u(x, t) represent a low-dimensional projection of concept intensity along an intrinsic coordinate x on
C. If u approximately obeys a weakly–nonlinear dispersive PDE (e.g. KdV),
                                        ∂t u + 6u ∂x u + ∂x3 u = 0,
then single-soliton solutions                        √                      !
                                           c             c
                                  u(x, t) = sech2          (x − ct − x0 )
                                           2            2
propagate with shape-preserving stability and elastic interactions. We interpret conceptual solitons as
compact, archetypal packets (“Queen,” “Tide”) that survive channel distortions better than diffuse
prose. This justifies encoding via tightly constrained motifs rather than verbose text.
5     Gesture Channels and Invariants
Define a gesture word as an equivalence class [g] ∈ π1 (SE(3) \ O) of trajectories modulo homotopy
relative to obstacles O. The semantic map F induces F∗ ([g]) in homology on C. Under broad distortions
Φ, the image Φ∗ F∗ ([g]) preserves rank-structure (Betti numbers) with high probability when assessed
via persistent homology on time-delay embeddings of sensor data. Practically:
    1. Record pose time series (IMU/vision) during dream-inspired gestures (e.g., arm-raise, circular
       sweep).
    2. Build delay embeddings; compute persistence diagrams.
    3. Treat persistence features as syndrome bits for decoding under Φ.
6     Language as a Noisy Channel
Words suffer homophonic and perceptual confusability. Model phonological encoding as a sequence
over a finite alphabet with channel W (y | x); design a codebook whose codewords are augmented by
gesture-syndromes. Decoding is maximum a posteriori over joint acoustic + gesture features. In effect,
the gesture layer acts as an error-correcting code wrapped around brittle lexical tokens.
                                                    2
7     Knots, Constraints, and Meaning Preservation
Knots formalize entanglement of constraints. A gesture that traces a closed loop with over/under
crossings can be projected to a knot diagram; invariants (e.g., Jones polynomial) serve as hashes of the
intended message-class. This leverages the fact that Φ may warp geometry but preserve combinatorial
crossing data with higher reliability than words.
8     Operational Protocol: From Dream to Data
(P1) Motif Extraction
Catalog archetypes (cards, tides), gestures (arm-raise, circular sweep), and spatial schemas (inside/outside
inversion). Assign each a unique operator Ôi acting on a cognitive state s ∈ X ⊂ Rd :
                                      st+1 = Ôi (st ) + ξt ,   ξt noise.
(P2) Soliton Packetization
Compose operators to synthesize short, high-contrast sequences (“packets”) that, when enacted, yield
distinctive time-series signatures (sharp, localized peaks in feature-space). Target shape-preserving
propagation across days/contexts (sleep/wake).
(P3) Topological Coding
Map enacted sequences to persistence diagrams; quantize stable features into code symbols. Store paired
{lexical token, gesture-code} and train a decoder on personal data.
(P4) Verification via Q&A Pairs
Adopt self-generated question–answer batteries where answers are encoded by gesture + minimal
words. Reliability is assessed by mutual information I(intended; decoded) and by test–retest stability of
topological features.
9     Applied Reading of Anchors
Cleopatra (Greene, pp. 236–240). Cleopatra’s mastery relies on presence, image, and gesture—codes
that bind perception without fragile lexical transfer. In our model, such signals occupy low-dimensional
manifolds with strong invariants, behaving like solitons through Φ.
Deutsch (Multiverse). Dream↔wake crossings act like traversals among nearby explanatory uni-
verses. Stable packets (archetypes/gestures) are knowledge carriers that replicate across branches more
reliably than verbose propositions whose decoding depends on shared background.
10      Measurement and Experiments
E1: Gesture Stability
Record N repetitions of each gesture-sequence over weeks; compute intra-class persistence distances
(Wasserstein/Bottleneck). Hypothesis: archetypal packets show lower dispersion than arbitrary motions.
                                                       3
E2: Multimodal Decoding
Fuse audio (if any), text, and pose into a joint embedding; evaluate message classification with and
without gesture-syndrome. Expect significant accuracy lift from the gesture layer under lexical corruption.
E3: Flood Inversion Test
Construct contextual inversions (“indoors flood”): present decoders with semantically inverted scenes;
measure whether gesture-syndrome still recovers intended class, testing robustness to frame reversal.
