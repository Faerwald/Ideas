       Parallelizable Fourier Transform for
           Time-Distributed Cognition

Abstract
This paper amalgamates multiple intertwined ideas: p-adic expansions and refined temporal moments,
an ultrametric “Eye of the Storm” perspective on information flow, a Time Brain-Computer Interface
(Time BCI) concept, and a more parallelizable variant of the Fourier transform. Each of these elements
is grounded in existing principles from physics and theoretical computer science. We explore how
recursive adjustments to a single pivotal time slice resemble p-adic refinement, how ultrametric or
topological constraints could underpin physical fields and chaotic control, how a Time BCI might exploit
advanced signals or subtle feedback loops, and how an alternative or factorized Fourier transform may
enable real-time decoding of hidden structure in high-dimensional signals.
1     Introduction
Moments in complex dynamical systems can often serve as anchors for feedback processes that extend
across time. This document relates four core themes:
    1. P-adic expansions of a single temporal moment: A conceptual mechanism for continuously
       adding “digits” of detail to an event without disturbing its coarse features.
    2. Ultrametric information flow (“Eye of the Storm”): The suggestion that conventional fields
       (electromagnetism, probability distributions) might emerge from deeper hierarchical or modular
       structures.
    3. Time BCI and retrocausality: A speculative yet structured idea in which advanced or hidden
       signals are harnessed by a neurocomputational loop, potentially revealing future knowledge.
    4. A new parallelizable Fourier transform: A potential breakthrough that simplifies coding,
       clarifies conceptual understanding, and accelerates large-scale signal processing.
   These ideas overlap in their reliance on hidden symmetries, hierarchical expansions, and transforms
that unify local and global properties of signals or states.
2     P-Adic Expansions as Temporal Refinement
2.1     Motivation
In standard real analysis, a number’s refinement involves extra digits appended to the right in a decimal
expansion, each becoming less significant in value. In a p-adic system, the norm is reversed: higher
powers of the prime p represent finer corrections that can dominate the effective distance in p-adic
topology.

2.2    Connection to a Single Event
Consider an event at time t0 (e.g. August 17, 2020). If one imagines that the event can be “overwritten”
by incremental adjustments (new digits) without invalidating prior structure, then p-adic thinking fits.
The left side of the p-adic expansion (lowest powers of p) remains stable, while higher powers refine
the moment from a non-Archimedean standpoint. In chaotic systems, such modifications can redirect
long-term trajectories without re-initializing the entire timeline. This view resonates with controlling
chaos via small but precisely tuned inputs at critical junctures.
2.3    Known Uses in Physics
P-adic numbers appear in select corners of mathematical physics:
    • P-adic String Theory: Early works by Volovich and others explored non-Archimedean norms in
      string amplitudes.
    • Quantum Mechanics and Lattices: Certain authors have considered discrete or ultrametric models
      for vacuum states or hidden variables.
Though not mainstream, these methods illustrate that reinterpreting distance and convergence can
reveal new structural insights into fundamental fields or state spaces.
3     Ultrametric Structures and the “Eye of the Storm”
3.1    Statement of the Eye of the Storm
A guiding statement suggests:
“Information flow in physics may not be Euclidean or continuous—it may be ultrametric, modular,and boundary-c
This implies that apparently smooth fields (e.g. electromagnetic waves or quantum probability ampli-
tudes) could be emergent from an underlying hierarchical geometry.
3.2    Ultrametric Topology
An ultrametric distance function d(x, z) ≤ max{d(x, y), d(y, z)} leads to strongly clustered state spaces,
often arranged in tree-like ways. Such geometries appear in:
    • Spin Glasses: The Parisi solution to mean-field spin glass models uses ultrametric organization
      of metastable states.
    • p-Adic AdS/CFT: Certain investigations reinterpret Anti-de Sitter spaces with non-Archimedean
      boundaries, revealing possible hierarchical re-constructions of correlation functions.
3.3    Implications for Field Theories
If fields we measure are only effective surfaces, topological or modular constraints might govern deeper
layers. This viewpoint can unify the seemingly disparate emergences of wave equations, symmetries,
and resonances in a single combinatorial or number-theoretic substrate.
4     Time BCI: Retrocausal and Recursive Loops
4.1    Motivation in Brain Dynamics
The brain can be modeled as a high-dimensional nonlinear system. Even minor influences can drastically
affect global states if they interact with chaotic attractors or feedback loops. The Time BCI hypothesis
posits:
                                                    2
    1. The possibility of advanced or retro signals, as allowed by certain non-mainstream quantum
       interpretations (e.g. transactional).
    2. A cybernetic method to detect or amplify these micro-signals in real time, especially if neural
       chaos acts as a magnifier.
    3. Cryptographic or data-logging approaches (e.g. blockchain timestamps) to verify the temporal
       oddities or faster-than-expected insights.
4.2     Role of a Fourier-Like Transform in EEG
Brainwave data typically undergoes spectral decomposition (Fourier or wavelet). If a newly paralleliz-
able transform can be computed in real time, it might reveal subtle correlations. Any advanced-wave
signature or unusual phase alignment could be measurable. Although direct retrocausality is specula-
tive, the engineering approach remains logically consistent if the system records pre-specified targets
and tests whether they match future events.
5     A More Parallelizable Fourier Transform
5.1     Classical FFT Challenges
The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) reduces naive O(N 2 ) complexity to O(N log N ) but remains recur-
sively structured. Parallelization on GPUs or distributed systems often requires careful data rearrange-
ments (butterfly patterns), with repeated communication passes that can hinder speedup.
5.2     Potential Breakthroughs
The professor’s claimed discovery might involve:
    • Novel Matrix Factorization: Rewriting the DFT matrix W into block or sparse forms with
      minimal inter-process communication.
    • Split- or Mixed-Radix Approaches: Exploiting prime factorization of N to implement sepa-
      rate partial transforms that combine more cleanly.
    • Direct Real-Valued Implementations: Decomposing exponentials into structured real blocks
      to reduce conceptual complexity and memory overhead.
    • Adaptive or Graph-Based Transform: A method that merges local neighborhood operations
      with global spectral properties, simplifying concurrency on large hardware arrays.
5.3     Linking to p-adic Factorization
In certain special cases, N = pk . Then discrete transforms factor along p-adic-like trees. One might
interpret the data distribution as layering hierarchical expansions. This can make the transform more
“intuitive” if we interpret indexing in a non-Archimedean manner, though a complete bridging of p-adic
geometry to standard signals requires additional domain adaptation.
6     Synthesis and Cohesion
6.1     Feedback from One Moment in Time
P-adic expansions, when interpreted as repeated refinement of a single moment, align with controlling
chaos in a time-distributed mind. Each new digit is a precise shift that can meaningfully alter future
evolutions, while preserving the macro-level structure of that original event.
                                                   3
6.2    Ultrametric Hierarchies as a Deeper Substrate
The “Eye of the Storm” perspective proposes that classical fields, wave equations, or probabilities might
be large-scale projections of an underlying symbolic or ultrametric environment. This resonates with
the use of p-adic expansions in advanced string theory or the hierarchical distribution of states in spin
glasses.
6.3    Time BCI and Parallel Fourier Analysis
If the brain truly can sense or integrate advanced signals, it would require a robust way to decode
ephemeral or chaotic patterns. A more parallelizable Fourier transform could facilitate near real-time
spectral feedback, letting a BCI detect micro-shifts that standard methods might miss or be too slow
to exploit. Combined with cryptographic time-stamping, one could attempt to demonstrate anomalies
in the order of knowledge acquisition.
6.4    Practical Boundaries and Speculations
While no mainstream consensus endorses large-scale retrocausality in neuroscience, the notion remains
consistent within certain interpretations of quantum mechanics or hypothetical hidden variable the-
ories. Meanwhile, advanced signal transforms and p-adic expansions can be rigorously explored in
standard mathematics and computational frameworks without invoking retrocausality. Their synergy
in this paper suggests a plausible (though speculative) narrative for bridging these discrete expansions,
ultrametric topologies, and advanced wave ideas within a single theoretical framework.
7     Conclusion
The interplay of p-adic refinement, ultrametric geometries, Time BCI aspirations, and a novel Fourier
transform reveals a unifying theme: hierarchical structure may underpin both our conventional signal
analysis and deeper physical processes. Each layer of analysis or speculation builds upon well-established
mathematics (p-adic norms, matrix factorizations), known but less mainstream physical constructs
(ultrametric spin glasses, string-theoretic expansions), and ongoing developments in computational
parallelism (split-radix FFT and advanced GPU methods). While definitive experimental validation of
retrocausal cognition remains elusive, the outlined concepts can be investigated in smaller-scale steps:
for instance, adopting the new Fourier transform approach for EEG or other high-dimensional signals,
examining chaotic feedback phenomena, and exploring p-adic expansions as an alternative lens for
controlling or interpreting complex dynamic systems.
