1. Introduction
Quantum theory, as famously described by Richard Feynman, teaches us that a particle (or photon, or
any quantum object) traveling from point 1 to point 2 does not simply follow a single path. Instead, it
“explores” all possible paths, each contributing an amplitude to the final outcome. The probability of
detecting the particle at point 2 is then determined by summing (adding) all of these complex amplitudes,
and only after that summation do we square the magnitude of the result to obtain a probability.
   In classical physics, we say objects follow the path of least action. But from the quantum perspective,
that is really just a consequence of how these complex amplitudes interfere: all the weird, loopy, detoured
paths usually cancel out, leaving the dominant contribution from the path(s) near the classical trajectory.
The reason for this cancellation is linked to the phase spinning around, which depends on the action of
the path.
2. Phase, Action, and the “Stopwatch” Metaphor
Phase as a “stopwatch.” A very helpful way to visualize these amplitudes is to imagine a little
“stopwatch hand” (or vector) that spins as the wave travels along each path.
   • When the wave starts at point 1, set the stopwatch hand to some reference direction.
   • As the wave moves along a path, the hand rotates in a circle (in the complex plane).
   • When the wave arrives at point 2, we stop the watch and record the final direction of the hand.
   Mathematically, that “stopwatch hand” (or rotating vector) is captured by a factor of
                                                   e iϕ ,

3. The Phase Accumulation Along a Path
Breaking the path into tiny segments. To understand where the phase comes from, consider splitting
any path into many small segments of length ∆x, eachtakeninasmalltimeinterval∆t.Duringeachsmallstep :

   More precisely, recall that for a matter wave (de Broglie wave):

                                             λ =     =    ,
                                                   p   mv
                                                     2πE
                                           ω = 2πf =       .
                                                        h
                                                                p
Since h/(2π)istypicallydenotedℏ, werewritetheseask = 2π

                                                          =     ℏ
                                                                  ,   and ω =    E
                                                                                 ℏ
                                                                                   .
   Hence, for each small segment,
                                                            p      E
                                ∆ϕ = k ∆x − ω ∆t =            ∆x −   ∆t.

Summing (integrating) all these increments along the path gives the total phase.

  4. Expressing Phase in Terms of Action
  Step-by-step derivation. Let us show how the classical action S emerges.
       1. Combine momentum and velocity: Since p = mv, then
                                p      mv      m (∆x/∆t)      mv 2
                                  ∆x =    ∆x =           ∆x =      ∆t.

         Notice how we used ∆x/∆t = v, soweintroduced∆t.
2. Energy term: The energy E in the simplest case is:
                                                                      1 2
                               E = Kinetic + Potential =                mv + V (x).
                                                                      2
  So
                                                         1

                                                           mv 2   + V (x)
                                             ∆t =                         ∆t.

                                                                            mv 2   + V (x)
                          ∆ϕ = ∆x −   ∆t =      ∆t −                                       ∆t.

  5. Why Only the “Least Action” Path Survives (Classical Limit)

  two nearby paths (say they differ in action by ∆S), therelativephasedif f erenceis∆ϕ = ∆Sℏ
                                                                                             . Even if

     Consequently, most paths will have phases pointing almost randomly when they reach the endpoint.
  When you sum a large number of random directions (vectors) in the complex plane, they tend to cancel
  out (destructive interference).

  Stationary Action → ConstructiveInterf erence
  By contrast, at the path of least action (sometimes more precisely called a stationary action path because it
  is a minimum or extremum with respect to small variations), small deviations in the path do not change the
  action S much, at least to first order in those small changes. That means the phases of those neighboring
  paths will all be almost the same:
                               ∆ϕ ≈ 0      =⇒     the vectors point the same way.
  Hence, these paths constructively interfere, building up a significant total amplitude. This is why, on a
  macroscopic level, we appear to see objects taking only the classical (least action) path.
  6. Conclusion and Key Takeaways
     • Quantum objects explore all paths. Each path contributes an amplitude eiS/ℏ .Macroscopic limit:F orl
• Classical path: The path (or set of paths) with stationary action (i.e. least or extremal action) has nearly
  the same phase as its neighboring paths, producing constructive interference. Thus, it dominates.
• Unified picture: This reproduces the principle of least action in classical physics and unifies wave-like
  interference with the idea of definite trajectories. In truth, every path is still there in the quantum sense,
  but we observe mainly the ones that survive the interference process.
  Historical Note. Richard Feynman developed the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics in
  the 1940s, showing that the amplitude to go from one point to another can be written as a sum (integral)
  over all possible paths. This method reproduces all of standard quantum mechanics (e.g. the Schrödinger
  equation) but also provides profound insights, including a direct connection to the classical principle of
  least action in the limit ℏ → 0.
