1     Branch–Relative Memory Recall in Relativistic Frames; Motivation
A single observer can remember incompatible fine details of a distant event (e. g. August 2020) without contradicting
physics. The mechanism is the conjunction of
    1. the relativity of simultaneity for extended observers, and
    2. branch structure in the Deutsch–Everett multiverse.
This note formalises that claim and provides quantitative scales.
2     Geometric model of the cognitive world–tube
Let the brain’s world–tube be
                                           xµ ∈ M1,3 |x − xcm (t)| ≤ R, t0 ≤ t ≤ t0 + ∆tact ,
                                       
                                W =
with representative parameters
                                               R ≃ 0.10 m,      ∆tact ≃ 300 ms.
Internal simultaneity. A recall act chooses a space–like hypersurface Σ(τ ) through W by requiring neuronal spikes
to coincide within ∆tsync ∼ O(1 ms).
Boost–induced tilt. If the body receives a small Lorentz boost Λ(δv), the normal one–form nµ of Σ transforms as
nµ → n′µ = Λµ ν nν . For a remote spacetime point X µ the change in coordinate time on the new slice is
                                                            δv · X
                                                         δt =      .                                                   (1)
                                                              c2
Taking |δv| ≃ 10−7 c (head motion, elevator acceleration) and |X| ≃ 5 ly, Eq. (1) yields δt ∼ 50 s, sufficient to exchange
entire microscopic trajectories inside the causal diamond of the remembered event.
3     Deutsch–Everett branch selection
                                                             P
In Everettian quantum mechanics the universal state is |Ψ⟩ =  α cα |α⟩ , a superposition of decohered histories α. A
memory entry m is accessed by a positive operator Em (Σ) supported on the neural degrees of freedom. Because Em
depends functionally on the slice Σ,
                                 Σ ̸= Σ′ =⇒ Em (Σ) ̸= Em (Σ′ ) =⇒ Pr(m) ̸= Pr′ (m).
                                                                           Σ         Σ
Hence two nearly identical recall commands can project onto different branches |α⟩ , |β⟩ whose macroscopic records
match yet whose under–determined fine structure (“peripheral facts”) diverges.
4     Invariant anchors versus contextual degrees of freedom
Analogous to the Lorentz invariants I1 = E2 −B2 , I2 = E·B, there exist branch–invariant traces: digitally time–stamped
photographs, cryptographic hashes, signed logs. All admissible branches intersecting a given Σ agree on those anchors.
   By contrast, contextual variables—ambient smells, eye–movement order, unlogged snippets of conversation—lack
such protection and differ freely between neighbouring branches. They are precisely the details that fluctuate in
successive recollections.
5     Empirical scale estimates
    • Boost magnitude. A chair swivel of 3 rev s−1 at radius 0.3 m produces tangential |δv| ≈ 5.6 × 10−8 c, half the
      benchmark used in Eq. (1).
    • Memory age dependence.         Environmental entropy erodes correlations at roughly λ−1 ∼ months, so the disper-

      sion σ(t) ≈ σ∞ 1 − e       grows rapidly for t ≳ 1 year, in qualitative agreement with everyday experience.
