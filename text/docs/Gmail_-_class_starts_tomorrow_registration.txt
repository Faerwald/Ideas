 Dear Students,
 Some of you have paid for my class on interstellar propulsion at the Society, but you are still showing up as
 "ghosted" (in gray font, with the word "Invited") on my class roster. You have NO access yet then to the
 Google Meet for the class; to the lectures, materials, etc. To fix this problem:
 1. Please click on the "Join" link you got from the director, Prof. Mike Cifone, by email, when you paid. If that
 does not work...
 2. Check your spam/junk folder, if you're unable to find the message w/ the link
 3. Note that if you found the email and clicked the link and it *still* doesn't work, then it could be because you
 have the wrong type of email account. You *must* have an account on GMAIL (ending in.. @gmail.com).
 Hotmail, Yahoo, AOL, proton etc. will NOT work and there is nothing we can do to fix the problem. If you don't
 have a GMail account then please make one, and try joining again
 4. From a GMail account, instead of finding the email, you can also click on this link directly: https://classroom.
 google.com/c/Nzg2MzgyNDc3NDMz?cjc=ukrigoqk (do not share this link publicly, however! This is ONLY for
 people who have paid)
 5. If even number 4 *still* doesn't work, you can also add the class using the secret code by first logging into
 Google classroom (at https://classroom.google.com/, but again a GMail account is a prerequisite) and clicking
 on "Join Class." Enter this code: ukrigoqk (again, NOT for public sharing...)
 Lastly, if you have already done this, with a new account, so you feel that you may have received this email in
 error, then please let me know what your old and new names/addresses are, and I will delete the old one and
 keep the new
 Best,
 - Prof. Matthew S.
