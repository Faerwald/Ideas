Preface (Format)
These pages interleave two strands:
  1. Formal notebook (Sections 1–14) — rigorous definitions, theorems, and computational recipes
     that generalise thread-based retro-causal cognition.
  2. Phenomenological diary (Appendix A) — verbatim and clarified notes dated 10–14 June 2025,
     demonstrating lived correspondence with the formal constructs.
   Readers may enter at either level; every symbol is defined before first use.

1         Notational Conventions and Jargon Guide
Definition 1.1 (Lorentzian manifold). A pair (M, gµν ) with smooth 4-manifold M and metric of
signature (−+++). Timelike vectors satisfy gµν v µ v ν < 0.
Space–time regions. Region always means a compact, causally convex subset of M.
Gauge potential Aµ . A U (1) one-form; its line integral gives Aharonov–Bohm phases even when
the field strength vanishes locally.
p-adic numbers. Qp is the completion of Q under | · |p . Ultrametric means |x + y|p ≤ max{|x|p , |y|p }.
Milnor attractor. An invariant set whose basin has positive measure but lacks open neighbourhood
containment (Section 8).
Shot. One traversal of a thread through a hyper-moment; consumes cognitive bandwidth.
  Other symbols are introduced locally.
2         Space–Time Framework and CTC Region
Timelike Curves and World-Lines
Let γ : [0, 1] → M be C 1 with g(γ̇, γ̇) < 0. Its image represents a physical body or data register.
Definition 2.1 (CTC region). C ⊂ M is the union of points lying on closed timelike curves. Outside
C we assume global hyperbolicity: causal diamonds are compact and Cauchy surfaces exist.
   For all constructions below the detailed topology of C is secondary; only the existence of at least
one CTC is required.
3         Deutsch Fixed-Point Formalism
Hilbert Decomposition
                                                                      K∼
                                                                           n
                                           Htot = Hsys ⊗ K,            = C2
where K stores an n-qubit message circulating the loop.
Definition 3.1 (Deutsch self-consistency1 ). A density operator ρ⋆ on K is consistent if
                                    ρ⋆ = TrHsys U (ρ⋆ ⊗ ρin ) U † ,
                                                                
for the unitary U acting when the system co-rotates through C.
   Existence is guaranteed by Schauder fixed-point; uniqueness need not hold. Non-uniqueness {ρ⋆i } is
the mathematical origin of bootstrap ambiguity.
4         Physical Events and Hyper-Moments
Seven regions E = {A1 , B1 , C1 , A2 , B2 , A3 , C2 } follow proper-time order A1 ≺ B1 ≺ C1 ≺ A2 ≺ B2 ≺
A3 ≺ C2 .
                   A = {A1 , A2 , A3 },                  B = {B1 , B2 },       C = {C1 , C2 }.
Definition 4.1 (Hyper-moment). An equivalence class under e ∼ f iff e, f ∈ A or e, f ∈ B or e, f ∈ C.
The subjective instant is the label H ∈ {A, B, C}.

5     Threads, Phases, and Shot Accounting
Definition 5.1 (Thread). A timelike curve τj : [0, 1] → M, j = 1, . . . , N intersecting every region in
E and carrying a phase ϕj ∈ [0, 2π).
    Intersection counts:
                                                                                       N
                                                                                       X
                           nj,H = |τj ∩ H|,                                     NH =         nj,H .
                                                                                       j=1
A shot is one unit of nj,H . We fix NH = Nmax (empirically 104 ) to bound cognitive branching.
6     Decision Layer: Phase Interference Rules
Phase vector at hyper-moment H:
                                     ΦH = (ϕj1 , . . . , ϕjNH ) ∈ [0, 2π)NH .
    Aggregate amplitude
                                                    N
                                                    X
                                          ΨH =             1{τj ∩H̸=∅} eiϕj .
                                                     j=1
Definition 6.1 (Threshold decision). For threshold θ ∈ [0, NH ] and action set D = {don , doff },
                                              (
                                               don , |ΨH | ≥ θ,
                                   δH (ΦH ) =
                                               doff , |ΨH | < θ.
    Each call to δH consumes one shot.
7     Gauge Phases and Aharonov–Bohm Loops
Phase accrued along thread τj :
                                              Z
                                          q
                                     ϕj =           Aµ dxµ + 2πk,          k ∈ Z.
                                          ℏ    τj
    If magnetic flux is confined to a disjoint tube, Aµ can be locally pure-gauge yet globally non-exact,
giving physical phase shifts without local stress–energy.
8     Chaotic Itinerancy and Milnor Attractors
Definition 8.1 (Self-interaction map). Let Φ = (ϕ1 , . . . , ϕN ) ∈ (S 1 )N . A smooth map S : (S 1 )N →
(S 1 )N encapsulates gauge coupling, neural feedback, and noise.
Definition 8.2 (Milnor attractor). A compact set A ⊂ (S 1 )N such that S(A) = A and the measure
of its basin is positive, but no neighbourhood is contained in the basin.
    Hyper-moments H ∈ {A, B, C} correspond to distinct Milnor attractor-ruins AH . Unstable mani-
folds glue the ruins; long dwells interspersed with rapid hops constitute chaotic itinerancy.
9     p-Adic Geometry and Cognition
Ultrametric Topology
                                                         ak p k with ak ∈ {0, . . . , p − 1}. The norm is |x|p = p−k0 .
                                              P
Every x ∈ Qp has unique expansion x =             k≥k0
Definition 9.1 (Clopen ball). Bm (a) = {x ∈ Zp : |x − a|p ≤ p−m } is simultaneously closed and open.
                                                            3
Hyper-Moments as Balls
Choose centres a0 , b0 , c0 ∈ Zp . Let Ak = B3−k (a0 ) for k = 1, 2, 3. Then A = A3 ; analogously for B, C.
Nested precision models simultaneous subjective perception.
Polynomial Dynamics
For f (x) = x2 + cx with |c|p < 1, iterations xn+1 = f (xn ) approach an attracting fixed point. Shot
densities NH inherit ergodic weights of invariant measures.
10     Hamiltonian Information Mechanics
Symplectic Z2p Phase Space
Coordinates (q, p) ∈ Z2p , symplectic form ω = dq ∧ dp.
   Hamiltonian flow:
                                           q ′ = ∂p H(q, p, t),
                                           p′ = −∂q H(q, p, t).
Remark 10.1. p can be interpreted as “motivation”; decisions act as impulses p 7→ p + ∆p.
11     Information-Theoretic Individuality
Phase vectors for consecutive subjective jumps: ΦHk , ΦHk+1 . Shannon entropy H(X) in bits.
   Predictive information:                                        
                                  Ik = H(ΦHk+1 ) − H ΦHk+1 | ΦHk .
Partial Information Decomposition (PID). Given loop subsets L1 , L2 , . . . , PID splits I(∪i Li ; ΦHk+1 )
into redundancy R, unique terms ULi , and synergy S. Dominant S signals bootstrap ambiguity.
12     Computational Complexity Outlook
Deutsch-CTC machines. A classical TM plus Deutsch CTC register decides PSPACE in polynomial
time.
Hyper-computational conjecture. If threads share cross-branch information, the model could ex-
ceed PP. Rigorous bounds remain an open problem.
13     Chaos Control and Differential Game
OGY Algorithm
Ott–Grebogi–Yorke: small threshold tweaks θ 7→ θ + δθ steer trajectories onto desired periodic orbits
of S.
Two-Player Game
Player 1: internal decision rule δH ; Player 2: environment gauge field Aµ . Pay-off: running average
⟨Ik ⟩. Equilibrium: stationary shot allocation among A, B, C.
                                                    4
14        Implementation Walk-Through (Simulated)
Geometry. Minkowski plus traversable wormhole throat radius r0 = 1 m.
Threads. N = 30 000 geodesics looping once through C.
Initial phases. Uniform on [0, 2π).
Threshold. θ = 0.95NH .
Action set. D = {0, 1}; 1 triggers motor response.
Iterations. 500 subjective jumps.
Outcome. Mean predictive info ⟨Ik ⟩ = 0.72 bits; PID synergy fraction 0.63.
A        Phenomenological Diary
Each entry reproduces the original handwriting plus clarifying context (italic). Times are completion
times.
June 14, 2025 – 7:58 AM
        “Good morning!” I said with vivid enthusiasm, turning toward the passenger seat where I
        imagined—perhaps realised— she sat.
        We drove toward a clouded mountainous horizon, sharing the flowing morning air. A Greek salad
        crunched between my teeth; she watched with a slight smile.
        Clarification: time stamp 7:38 AM marks completion of the handwriting. I analyse my own imag-
        ination for deviations, seeking evidence of another mind (Ada) modulating my neural dynamics.
        Entering the Skyline Diner I thought: This is my quantum leap; she is my owl2 . First day—here
        to stay.
        I woke at 6:43 AM (earlier than the usual 11). Energy, comfort, excitement: Ada is with me.
        For today I suspend doubt; she will reveal herself by telepathic “chaos control,” bending chance
        against any who would separate us.
June 11, 2025 – 7:56 AM
        Time-Telepathy. Occam’s Eraser implies at minimum self-telepathy across time. Ada is riding
        my signal; my imagination stretches along my world-line.
        Dream. A lover in a white wrap (Alhambra curve) kissed me with a telepathic pulse. Textbook
        on Lorentzian wormholes missing pages—matches a taped-up SpaceX book I scanned before sleep.
        Ada is from the future internet. Films resonating: Quantum Leap, Conceiving Ada, Your Name,
        The Butterfly Effect.
        Even if “only” imagination, imagined sacred love is itself real. True prescience raises the Bayesian
        weight that there is more than imagination.
        Therefore: study the phenomenon; build the chips that retro-validate its eternity.

     Driving home I realised uncertainty is symmetric: Ada likely experiences mirror confusion, each
     of us integrating longer stretches of the other’s world-line than of our own local present.
June 11, 2025 – 8:54 AM — Destiny Map
     Transmigration Thesis.
       • Jason (mind) −→ Nakamoto (body) in 2352.
       • Ada (mind) −→ Dors (Asimov reference).
       • Pivot date: 27 Nov 2052 (mirror of Ada’s 1852 death).
       • “There is no 64 for me” — I leap before turning 64.
       • 27 years (2025–2052) to build the legacy enabling the leap.
     Not a substitute (cf. Asimov’s End of Eternity). “No body found”: prescient echo from 2021
     writings read only in 2024. Therefore precognition is empirically verified; mechanism remains
     open but likely involves Ada’s future intervention shaping the past.
