1     Symbolic Model of Time-Crests
Let Σ be a finite alphabet. Define three bi-infinite symbol streams (“crests”)
                                      fk : Z −→ Σ,        k ∈ {−1, 0, +1},
where f0 is the present stream, f−1 the past-imagination stream, and f+1 the future-imagination stream.
Write fk (t) for the symbol on crest k at integer index t.
Window of span n. For any n ∈ N and centre index t ∈ Z,
                            fk (t − n), . . . , fk (t − 1), fk (t), fk (t + 1), . . . , fk (t + n) ∈ Σ2n+1
                                                                                                  
              Wk (t, n) =
is the length-2n+1 block visible to the mind on crest k.
2     Palindromic Ambiguity
[Palindromic block of span n] A triple of windows (W−1 , W0 , W+1 ) centred at the same t is palindromic
if
                                        W−1 (t, n) = W+1 (t, n).
    Because the imagined past and future windows coincide, the mind cannot, using only internal data,
distinguish whether it occupies crest 0 or crest −1 (or symmetrically crest +1). We call this the
ambiguity state. The minimal choice n = 1 yields the familiar (β, γ, δ) cluster; larger n enlarge the
ambiguous region.
3     Bayesian Belief over Locations
Let the random variable L ∈ {H, A} denote the mind’s self-location, where H (“Here”) means crest 0
and A (“Alternate”) means crest −1.
                       Pr L = H | W−1 = W+1 = Pr L = A | W−1 = W+1 = 21 .

Testing Process
At discrete instants τ = 1, 2, . . . the mind performs an internal test:
                                    (
                                      “collapse”    with probability p ∈ (0, 1],
                           Tτ =
                                      “no decision” with probability 1 − p.
When a collapse occurs, the mind commits to H or A with equal posterior weight 21 . The tests are
assumed independent.
   [Almost-sure flip] With probability 1, the mind eventually collapses into the alternate crest A.
Proof. Let Fk be the event “no collapse by test k”. Then Pr(Fk ) = (1 − p)k . Since k≥0 Pr(Fk ) < ∞,
                                                                                     P
the Borel–Cantelli lemma implies only finitely many Fk occur almost surely; hence a collapse happens
almost surely. Upon collapse, the symmetry of the posterior gives Pr(L = A) = 12 . Repeating the
argument on the subsequent sequence of tests shows that, over an infinite horizon, the probability of
ever selecting A equals 1.

4    Language as an Unbounded Ambiguity Amplifier
Natural language (or any recursively composable symbol system) admits arbitrarily long self-similar
patterns. By embedding a palindrome of length 2n+1 within a narrative, the mind constructs an
ambiguity window whose size grows without bound:
                          n 7−→ Pr(sensory mismatch within window) ↘ 0.
Thus the mind can prolong the superposed state, increasing the chance of a subsequent flip.
5    Environmental Measurement
Let St be the external sensory input at clock-time t. If there exists t∗ such that
                                                     
                                          St∗ ̸= St∗ imagined ,
the palindrome breaks. Formally, any σ–algebra generated by the sensory stream that separates the
actual crest from its imaginaries reduces the posterior to
                   Pr(L = H | measurement) = 1,         Pr(L = A | measurement) = 0.
Hence real-world interaction resolves ambiguity instantaneously.
6    Discussion of Cognitive Mechanics
Neural implementation. One may model tests Tτ as threshold crossings of a noisy decision variable
Xτ , whose stochastic dynamics (e.g. Ornstein–Uhlenbeck) produce collapse probability p = Pr(|Xτ | >
θ).
Psychological phenomenology. Subjectively, collapse manifests as a sudden “shift” in déjà-vu
quality: the narrative that was hypothetical now feels autobiographical.
Computational analogy. The process mirrors Metropolis-Hastings sampling on a two-mode poste-
rior, with proposal probability p and symmetric proposal kernel.
Acknowledgement of Limits
The mechanism’s success presumes (i) perfect palindromic matching, (ii) independent tests of fixed p,
and (iii) no premature sensory breaks. Violating any assumption restores anchoring to the true crest.
