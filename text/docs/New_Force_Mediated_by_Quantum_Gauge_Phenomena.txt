                                                 Abstract
          We develop a theoretical framework suggesting the emergence of a new force arising from
      gauge-invariant quantum phase shifts in the vector potential A. The Aharonov–Bohm effect and
      related phenomena indicate that gauge potentials can induce physically measurable consequences
      even where classical fields vanish. We argue that such effects, when coupled to macroscopically
      responsive systems, can lead to energy redistribution and momentum exchange driven by purely
      phase-based interactions—a mechanism distinct from standard electromagnetism and gravitation.
      By analyzing the coupling of quantum phase information with system trajectories, we propose
      that an irreducible gauge structure may underlie a new category of force, potentially relevant for
      advanced propulsion concepts, quantum information processing, and topological field theories.
1     Introduction
A key observation from quantum mechanics is that interference effects can be influenced by potentials,
rather than merely fields. The seminal Aharonov–Bohm (AB) effect [1] demonstrates that electrons
(or other quantum particles) acquire a measurable phase shift due to the electromagnetic vector poten-
tial A, even when traversing regions in which the classical fields, E and B, are zero. This phenomenon
highlights the nontrivial role of gauge potentials in quantum theory, leading to a paradigm shift in the
understanding of physical reality at small scales.
    Subsequent experiments show that similar topological phase shifts occur for neutral particles as well
(e.g., neutrons [2]), suggesting a deeper significance to gauge potentials that transcends the electric
charge. Historically, these effects have been viewed as exotic corner cases; however, contemporary
research in topological quantum field theory (TQFT) [3, 4], quantum information [5], and condensed
matter physics [6] has reinvigorated interest in the broader implications of gauge invariance.
    In this paper, we propose that gauge-invariant phase information can give rise to a new force when a
quantum system is embedded in a macroscopic setting and is sensitive to phase-based cues. Specifically,
we focus on how energy and momentum can be exchanged via A-dependent phase shifts, effectively
creating a gauge-mediated interaction not reducible to standard electromagnetic or gravitational forces.
2     Gauge Realism and Quantum Potentials
2.1    Beyond Fields: The Primacy of A and φ
Classical electromagnetism typically treats A and the scalar potential φ as convenient mathematical
constructs for describing fields E and B. The AB effect reveals, however, that A is physically significant
at the quantum level. Formally, the wavefunction of a charged particle acquires a phase factor
                                                    I
                                                  q
                                           ∆φ =        A · dr,                                         (1)
                                                 ℏ C
even if E = B = 0 along the path C. This phenomenon underscores the concept of gauge realism [8],
in which potentials hold ontological status rather than serving merely as mathematical artifacts.
                                                      1
2.2    Spin, Symmetry, and Phase Universality
While spin arises from nontrivial representations of rotation groups (e.g., SU(2) for spin- 12 ), gauge
invariance is governed by local phase rotations that leave physical observables invariant. These internal
symmetries couple to the potentials (A, φ) in quantum field theories. For instance, spin- 21 fields in
QED interact via minimal coupling p → p − qA, but even neutral objects can couple to A through
higher-order or topological terms [2]. Thus, the effect of A is not confined to charged systems; it may
also manifest in neutral or composite particles whose internal gauge structure is sensitive to the phase.
2.3    Topological Considerations
Central to the AB effect is the topology of the gauge field configuration. The integral in Eq. (1)
depends only on the magnetic flux enclosed by the path, not the local field at every point. This global
or topological character suggests that gauge potentials can encode nonlocal information. Non-Abelian
generalizations (e.g., SU(2), SU(3)) exhibit even richer phase behaviors, which may hint at novel forces
or emergent phenomena if macroscopically harnessed [7].
3     Trajectory Uncertainty and Path Integral Formulations
3.1    Quantum Propagation
Quantum evolution can be described by path integrals
                                            Z          h       i
                                 Ψ(r, t) =     D[C] exp ℏi S[C] ,                                    (2)
where S[C] is the action functional along a path C. The presence of a gauge potential A contributes a
term of the form                                    Z
                                         Sgauge = q A · dr,
leading to interference among the multiple paths consistent with the same boundary conditions. The re-
sulting quantum amplitude is sensitive to the gauge-dependent phase factors, and thus gauge potentials
can shift interference patterns even when E and B vanish locally.
3.2    Trajectory Ambiguity and Macroscopic Feedback
In many scenarios, the precise path C may be uncertain or even actively chosen by a macroscopic
system (e.g., a feedback controller, a computational decision process). If that system monitors phase-
induced outcomes (e.g., interference minima/maxima) and adapts accordingly, the gauge potential
can indirectly drive certain trajectory choices. This synergy between quantum path integrals and
macroscopic feedback loops has the potential to engender genuine momentum and energy exchanges
mediated by A, effectively acting as a new interaction.
4     Gauge-Mediated Energy Exchange and Emergent Force
4.1    Noether Currents and Momentum Shifts
According to Noether’s theorem, continuous symmetries of the action are tied to conserved currents.
In electromagnetism, the canonical momentum shift for a charged particle is p → p − qA. However, if
a macroscopic system adjusts its internal or external configuration in response to changes in A, a net
momentum flow may arise without classical E or B. Formally, one might write
                                            ∆p = − q ∆A,                                             (3)
                                                   2
where ∆A is the variation in the local gauge potential. This shift can translate into a real force if it is
coupled to an extended system that undergoes net displacement or rearrangement of internal degrees
of freedom.
4.2    Energy Transfer and Phase Shifts
An alternative viewpoint focuses on energy considerations. Over a characteristic timescale T , a net
phase change ∆φ can yield an energy exchange
                                                     ℏ
                                             ∆E ≃      ∆φ,                                            (4)
                                                     T
if the system’s evolution is explicitly phase-dependent. This relationship mirrors how electromagnetic
waves in free space impart momentum to charged particles, except here the impetus stems primarily from
gauge-invariant phase. If a device harnesses ∆φ to modulate mechanical or computational processes,
the net energy flow could be interpreted as arising from a new force, distinct from classical fields, but
emergent from quantum gauge couplings.
4.3    Neutral Particles and Generalized Gauge Groups
One might initially assume that only charged particles are subject to forces mediated by A. Yet
experiments show that the AB effect can be generalized to particles with no net charge if they possess an
internal gauge structure or relevant magnetic moment [2]. Moreover, in non-Abelian gauge theories (e.g.,
QCD-like models, or novel gauge frameworks), phase shifts can arise from more intricate potentials.
Thus, a generalized form of the new force may emerge in systems with nontrivial global or local gauge
properties, even when the net charge is zero.
5     Macroscopic Implications and Experimental Scenarios
5.1    Phase-Sensitive Devices and Propulsion Concepts
If the proposed force is real and measurable, one of the most tantalizing applications is in propulsion,
where a macroscopic object exploits gauge potentials for trajectory control. Imagine a device whose
internal quantum states are interferometrically sensitive to A. By altering boundary conditions or
flux configurations, the device might exchange momentum with the vacuum or with localized gauge
fields, performing net work. Though speculative, such ideas connect with attempts to harness nonlocal
quantum phenomena for advanced propulsion [9].
5.2    Gauge-Sensitive Quantum Computation
Another avenue lies in quantum computation. If the computational logic is encoded in phase-dependent
interference patterns, the presence of A can modulate which computational paths dominate, thereby
changing output states and subsequent macroscopic processes (e.g., which images get printed, which
circuit elements get energized). In principle, by measuring shifts in resource consumption or processing
outcomes, one can detect the new force as a subtle energy/momentum shift correlated with gauge
potential variations.
5.3    Topological Field Theories and Hidden Interactions
The new force hypothesis resonates with aspects of topological field theories [3], where local gauge
fields and boundary conditions define globally measurable indices. Nontrivial gauge holonomies and
fluxes might furnish a hidden sector for energy transfer. In parallel, the study of Berry phases and
geometric phases in quantum mechanics [10] likewise underscores how phase accumulations can yield
real physical effects. Building on these analogies may solidify the theoretical underpinnings of gauge-
driven interactions.
                                                    3
6    Conclusions and Outlook
We have argued that gauge potentials can, under certain conditions, mediate a new force that is
not encapsulated by classical E or B fields, nor by standard gravitational fields. By focusing on the
quantum mechanical phase shift—and how it can be harnessed by macroscopically responsive systems—
we establish a plausible mechanism for energy and momentum transfer via A alone. While extensive
experimental and theoretical work remains to confirm or refute this proposal, the potential ramifications
span advanced propulsion, quantum computation, and the broader quest to unify gauge interactions
within and beyond the Standard Model.
