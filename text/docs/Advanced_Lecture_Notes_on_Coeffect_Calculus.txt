1     Introduction
Coeffect calculus generalizes traditional effect systems, enabling precise modeling and control of context-
dependent computations. Introduced by Orchard and Schrijvers [1], coeffects capture environmental constraints
and resource sensitivities, thus providing a systematic formalism to reason about contextual information in
computations.
2     Motivation and Background
Traditional effect systems capture side-effects such as state mutation or I/O operations through algebraic
effects. Conversely, coeffect systems handle computations that depend on context—such as variable scope,
security levels, or linearity constraints—focusing on the input or environment of a computation rather than its
output.
    Effect systems traditionally classify computations according to the side effects they produce: Coeffect
systems dually classify computations by the context they require:
3     Theoretical Foundations
Coeffect calculus is typically based on categorical semantics, rooted in: Monoidal categories:
    • Contexts modeled as monoidal structures.
    • Composition respects coeffect annotations.
   Types and Judgments: The general form of a coeffect judgment: Here, c denotes the coeffect annotation,
characterizing the resources or contexts required by the computation e.
4     Coeffect Algebras
Coeffect algebras are usually structured as semiring-like algebraic structures (C, ⊕, ⊗, 0, 1), defining how coef-
fects compose and interact:
    • Addition (+): Merging contexts (choice).
    • Multiplication (×): Combining context requirements (composition).
    • Zero (0): Absence of context.
    • Identity (1): No additional context required.
    Coeffect algebras often involve semirings or more general algebraic structures, enabling algebraic manipu-
lation and inference.
5     Core Concepts and Definitions
5.1   Contextual Typing Judgments
The core coeffect typing judgment is of form:
   Γ⊢e:τ |c
                                                        1
5.2   Coeffect Algebra
Coeffect systems typically assume a partially ordered coeffect algebra (C, ≤, ∧, ∨) to manage ordering and
composition of contexts.
   Monotonicity condition:
5.3   Coeffect Operations
    • Weakening: Extending contexts, making requirements less restrictive.
    • Contraction: Reducing context duplication.
    • Exchange: Context permutation, maintaining equivalence under reordering.
5.4   Coeffect Quantification
Coeffect systems often include quantification over coeffects: allowing polymorphic or parametric contextual
requirements, significantly enhancing expressivity and abstraction.
6     Semantics and Interpretation
Coeffects can be semantically interpreted via categorical semantics or model-theoretic approaches:
    • Categorical Semantics: Uses comonads and monoidal categories.
    • Denotational Semantics: Assigns mathematical meanings to contexts, capturing computationally
      relevant aspects explicitly.
6.1   Relation to Effect Systems
Coeffects are formally dual to effects. Effects describe how computation changes the environment:
    • Effects: output-oriented, forward-looking.
    • Coeffects: context-dependent requirements and backward-oriented information-flow.
   This duality suggests complementary calculi can coexist, enhancing expressivity and formal reasoning in
programming languages.
7     Applications
Coeffect calculus is applicable in:
    • Context-aware programming
    • Security and information flow
    • Resource-sensitive computation
    • Type systems with context-dependent constraints
8     Conclusion
Coeffect calculus enriches traditional computational semantics, systematically handling contextual information
through rigorous algebraic structures and logical rules. Its systematic framework extends traditional program-
ming paradigms by explicitly incorporating context, enabling more expressive, precise, and robust software
development.
