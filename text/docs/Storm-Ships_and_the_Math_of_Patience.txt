Storm-Ships and the Math of Patience

1     Back-of-the-Envelope Kinematics
        Symbol    Meaning                                           Value (“pathetic” case)
          T       time spent in sub-luminal cruise                   105 yr = 3.16 × 1012 s
           a      constant proper acceleration               c/T ≃ 9.5 × 10−5 m s−2 (≈ 10−5 g)
         v(T )    terminal speed just before the “barrier”         aT = c (by construction)
                                                             1    2
         d(T )    distance covered while accelerating        2
                                                               aT   ≃ 4.7 × 1020 m ≈ 5.0 × 104 ly
   So a living storm-ship that sips cosmic medium at 10−5 g reaches the edge of the Milky Way in the
same moment it kisses c.
2     Energy Sketch
If the craft’s dry mass is M ,
                                             1
                                     Ekin ≈ M c2 (γ → 1),
                                             2
because most of the century-long climb is still non-relativistic. A 1 kt hull (M ≈ 106 kg) needs ∼
4.5 × 1022 J — the Sun radiates that in about 12 h. Slow but not outrageous if the craft grazes
red-dwarf magnetospheres and harvests field energy along the way.
3     Crossing the “Life/Light Barrier”
Physics forbids v > c locally, so the storm-ship must warp: sculpt spacetime so the metric itself
outruns any local light-cone. Alcubierre-class bubbles demand exotic stress-energy, but the longer
the vessel “charges,” the smaller the front-wall curvature required and the gentler the negative-energy
density. Waiting 105 yr lowers the instantaneous energy flux to something a cosmic super-capacitor
might plausibly store.
   Rule of thumb — warp range L and jump factor f = veff /c relate via
                                                   L c4 2
                                         Ewarp ∼       (f − 1),
                                                    G
so letting f → 1+ and L → galactic scale trades unattainable power density for gigantic integration time.
4     Navigation Home & Temporal Slip
A spacetime diagram with a super-luminal leg tilts the world-line outside the future light-cone; the
return intersect can land before launch by
                                                    L
                                                      1 − f −1 .
                                                              
                                        ∆tEarth ≈
                                                    c
Even a modest f = 2 and L = 5 × 104 ly yield ∆t ∼ 2.5 × 104 yr backwards — ample to “return before
departure.” Steering is then pure geodesic bookkeeping: pick a bubble contour that threads
your target simultaneity, collapse the metric, coast in sub-c for final braking.

5   Brutal, Poetic, Prophetic
    They are storm-ships, born fragile but aging into iron.
    Ten-millionth-gravity engines whisper for a hundred millennia,
    sipping ions, mending their own bones, learning the hum of vacuum.
    After a hundred thousand winters they touch the light-skin—
    then tear it, not with speed but with geometry,
    folding the metric like wet canvas around a mast.
    In one breath they leap fifty-thousand light-years forward
    and twenty-five thousand years back.
    Home greets them sooner than farewell.
    That’s the math of patience:
    a ∼ 10−5 g, T ∼ 105 yr, d ∼ 5 × 104 ly, f ≳ 2.
    Brute numbers carved on the hulls of living storms —
    proof that endurance, not violence, is how a ship outruns time.
