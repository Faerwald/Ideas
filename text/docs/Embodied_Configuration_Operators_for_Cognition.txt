Embodied Configuration Operators for Cognition
Abstract
Dream gestures—raising both arms “to be taller,” crawling → hunched → upright → arms-up, falling
backwards while instructing oneself to “trust,” manipulating glasses and watches (backwards, redundant,
forgotten)—are modeled as formal operators on an embodied state. We show: (i) self-measurements
(e.g., height) are gauge-dependent functionals over configuration; (ii) a compact operator algebra on
posture, rotation, and instrumentation induces controlled shifts of perceptual metrics; (iii) falls/near-falls
reveal a dissociation between explicit instruction and implicit predictive control (optimal feedback); (iv)
instrumentation (glasses/watches) are meta-perceptual/time gauges that alter observation and temporal
priors. The result is a reproducible protocol converting dream-derived gestures into testable constructs
in control theory, information geometry, and ecological neuroscience.
1     Dream Observables and Hypothesis
Observables. (a) Arms-up redefines “height.” (b) Evolutionary mime: crawling → hunched → upright
→ arms-up. (c) Fall with partial arrest by arms. (d) Glasses inverted/removed/duplicated; two watches
on one wrist.
    Hypothesis. These behaviors implement a configuration calculus in which identity-relevant mea-
surements (height, orientation, timing) are functionals on a configuration manifold and are actively
re-gauged by simple, composable operators.
2     Configuration, Measurement, and Gauge
Let Q be a differentiable configuration manifold for a human body model with n DoF (e.g., joint angles);
let {Tj (q) ∈ SE(3)}Jj=1 be forward-kinematics transforms at configuration q ∈ Q for J segments.
Definition 1 (Gauge-Dependent Measurement). Fix a set of landmarks L attached to body segments
and a selection U ⊆ L. Define the height functional
                             HU (q) = max e⊤
                                           z xℓ (q),         xℓ (q) = Tj(ℓ) (q) vℓ ,                      (1)
                                         ℓ∈U
where ez is the world-up axis and vℓ the local landmark. The choice of U is a gauge specifying which
parts constitute “self” for measurement.
Proposition 1 (Arms-Up Increases Height Only in Gauges that Include the Arms). Let Ucore exclude
distal arm/hand landmarks and Ufull include them. Then for configurations q differing only by shoul-
der/elbow elevation, HUcore (q) is constant while HUfull (q) strictly increases when arms are raised (ignoring
joint limits).
    Thus the dream’s “I am taller with arms up” is true under gauge Ufull and false under Ucore : identity
metrics are not absolute but measurement-gauge contingent.
    More generally, let M be a family of Riemannian/Finsler metrics on Q. Perceived length, effort, and
distance-to-goal depend on g ∈ M, producing distinct geodesics and control costs for the same physical
task.

3      An Operator Algebra on Embodiment
We introduce composable operators acting on (q, g, U ):
                         B : bipedalization (raise CoM, reduce contacts),                                          (2)
                         Q : quadrupedalization (lower CoM, increase contacts),                                    (3)
                         E : expansion (arms elevation/abduction),                                                 (4)
                        Rθ : world/body rotation by θ ∈ SO(2) (or SO(3)),                                          (5)
                        Td : translation by d ∈ R3 ,                                                               (6)
                        G± : glasses: invert/restore observation mapping,                                          (7)
                        W2 : dual time-gauge (two watches; redundant clocks).                                      (8)
Their action is
                                                                      O
                                                    (q, g, U ) 7−−→ (q ′ , g ′ , U ′ ),                            (9)
with q = O · q (kinematic move), g = O · g (metric/gain update), and U = O · U (measurement set
       ′                                    ′                                                           ′
update). In general, Rθ E ̸= ERθ (non-commutativity), and G± acts on the observation model hq : Q → X
(“what is seen”) rather than on body state directly.
Evolutionary Mime as Word in the Algebra. The sequence Q → B → E is a word in this
monoid, moving from quadrupedal ground-contact control to upright balance to expanded posture
(arms-up). The dream encodes developmental/evolutionary priors as a compact operator sequence.
4      Falls, Trust, and Predictive Control
Let body state xt evolve under dynamics xt+1 = f (xt , ut ) + wt , observations yt = h(xt ) + vt . Optimal
Feedback Control (OFC) solves
                                        "                        #
                                min                 ℓ(xt , ut )           s.t. dynamics, x0 ∼ P0                  (10)
                                            X
                                {ut }           t
with feedback ut = π(y≤t ). The dream’s backward fall shows dissociation:
    • Explicit instruction “trust yourself” (lexical prior) did not prevent the fall.
    • Implicit foresight emerged: arms extend to reduce impact. This is OFC with short-horizon reflexive
      control minimizing an impact cost.
Proposition 2 (Implicit Foresight from Cost Shaping). If terminal cost penalizes impact velocity at
contact, LT = α∥vimpact ∥2 , the optimal controller generates pre-contact limb extension to maximize
deceleration time, consistent with the observed arm use.
5      Glasses and Watches as Meta-Gauges
Vision gauge (G± ). Let the observation model be y = hq (x) with a learned mapping ĥq . Wearing
glasses backwards induces an approximate inversion/incongruence h̃q ; removing glasses reduces acuity
and changes the Fisher information of x given y. Duplicated glasses (or swapping) probes invariances of
hq .
Time gauge (W2 ). Two watches implement redundant timebases t1 , t2 , allowing cross-checking of
temporal prediction error. Formally, inference becomes
                                                    h                                                         i
                         x̂(t) = arg min                          F(x ; y)               +λ ∥t1 − t2 ∥        ,
                                            x                     |   {z      }              |    {z    }
                                                        free-energy / prediction error      clock coherence
testing robustness of temporal priors to gauge duplication or drift.
                                                                          2
6    Identity as a Gauge Choice
Define identity-relevant features ϕ : Q → Rm (e.g., stature, reach). The self at posture q under gauge
(g, U ) is the tuple                                                    
                               Self(q; g, U ) = ϕ(q), HU (q), effortg (q) .
The dream’s claim “if I go around with arms up, that is my height” is formalized as a convention: fixing
U = Ufull as the default measurement set redefines stature; the operator E updates U and thus the
self-measure.
7    From Dream Protocol to Experiments
E1: Gauge-Dependence of Height. Record motion-capture sequences with arms down vs. arms
up; compute HUcore and HUfull across trials. Expect selective increase only for Ufull .
E2: Operator Non-commutativity. Compare sequences Rθ ◦ E and E ◦ Rθ ; analyze differences in
balance cost and visual flow to quantify non-commutativity via integrated control effort.
E3: Fall Cost Shaping. Perturb balance on a compliant surface; measure pre-impact kinematics
with/without explicit instruction. OFC models with terminal impact penalties should predict pre-contact
arm extension; compare model–data.
E4: Vision/Time Meta-Gauges. Run visuomotor tasks under normal vs. inverted/blurred optics,
and single vs. dual clocks; evaluate changes in state-estimation uncertainty and temporal prediction
error.
E5: Evolutionary Word. Induce the sequence Q → B → E; quantify changes in reachable sets,
stability margins, and perceived affordances, testing the “evolutionary mime” as a compact control
program.
