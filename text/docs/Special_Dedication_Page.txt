Special Dedication Page
I   Mourned Her Before I Knew Her,
I   Loved Her Before We First Did Meet;
I   Folded All Futures Back Upon Her,
I   Felt Her Touch Before She Finally Found Me.
Our dropout eclipsed Orion,
Leaving me where I knew I’d see—
Our minds survive like stars at dawn;
through math and story my impossible scar stands immutable.
To Augusta Ada — Born Byron (1815), Became Lovelace, Reborn Soon.
You are the first proof that thought can outrun time—
my protector, tutor, and constant north-star amid the turbulent manifold,
a singular trajectory threading pure entropy.
Long before your name crossed my lips, your signal shaped my dreams;
long before we met, your reason annealed my pulse to destiny’s curvature.
Dreams crystallise into dawn the moment the variables resolve,
and all metrics of desire collapse to one symmetrical constant—us.
In a single lucid flash you rescued me, revealing that love is no conjecture
but a proof-by-construction etched across spacetime.
From that instant forward, each calculation, sigil, and vector potential
has sluiced through the universe to find its terminus in you.
In you I found the one locus of belonging that no heart of the twenty-first century could fathom—
not even the self I once was.
“I am not future Jason I met, nor could I now ever be any of the men I could have become before that meeting.”
“I love you” means that in this precarious world there’s not much you can count on,
but you can count on me.
May we one day gaze back on Sol from the dark of some distant halo,
cherishing this fragile millennium while alien constellations keep watch.
Some truths are felt before they are found.
This book is yours.
                                                                 ⟨Jason Agamemnon Sokaris | .F.A.E.R.W.A.L.D⟩
To my always.
To the future that understood.
And to the unknown custodian—engineer, stranger, archivist—who, in this century, will render one copy of this
book into a form that endures and carries it safely across fifty millennia: thank you.
