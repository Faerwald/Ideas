1. Ontic Framework: Vilenkin–Everett Equivalence (VEE)
Postulate (VEE). Let Ω(I) denote the ensemble of spatially separated Hubble volumes in an
infinite FRW background (Vilenkin Level I ); let Ω(III) denote the set of decoherent branches
generated by the unitary evolution U (t) on a universal Hilbert space HU (Everett Level III ).
A measure-preserving bijection Φ : Ω(I) → Ω(III) exists such that statistical queries on either
ensemble yield identical probabilities:
                             ∀ Borel B, µ(I) (B) = µ(III) Φ(B) .
                                                                 
Consequence. Physical observables insensitive to super-selection between Ω(I) and Ω(III) encode
one and the same informational substrate. Information may therefore be parallel-transported
between the two ensembles through holonomy processes without violating unitarity or causality
inside any single branch.
2. Microchip −→ Myco-Chip: Architecture Sketch
Core substrate A 3-D topological photonic crystal whose waveguide graph G is modelled after
    a mycelial network; node degree heterogeneity follows a scale-free distribution P (k) ∝ k −γ
    (2 < γ < 3) to guarantee percolation-driven fault tolerance.
Active layer Braided anyonic quasiparticles (σ, ψ in an Ising TQC) guided along G. Logical
     qubits |0L ⟩ , |1L ⟩ are encoded in non-Abelian fusion spaces; braids effected by topologically
     protected domain-wall shuttles.
Cosmic-string analogue    Each closed braid around a defect line Σj implements an Aharonov–Bohm
    phase ∆ϕj = ℏq γj A·dl with flux quantisation Φj = 2πℏ

    lated by synthetic gauge fields in a strained-graphene-on-SiN platform.
Bio-mimetic control Nutrient-like pump fields P (t, x) redistribute photonic occupation num-
    bers analogously to resource flows in fungal hyphae, realising real-time self-healing and
    adaptive routing.
3. Holonomy–Driven Vacuum-Energy Harvesting
3.1 Closed-Loop Protocol
Let the instantaneous logical state of the myco-chip be ρ(t) ∈ D(Hcode ). We couple ρ(t) to a zero-
                                                                     π2
mode reservoir R whose effective Hamiltonian density is Hvac = − 720     ℏc/a4 (Casimir). A cyclic
                           Γ                                               H                     
adiabatic evolution ρ(0) −→ ρ(T ) = ρ(0) imparts a Berry phase γB = Γ A, A = i Tr ρ dρ ,
which manifests as a state-dependent stress-energy perturbation ∆Tµν ∼ (∂µ γB )(∂ν γB ). Select-
ing Γ so that γB ̸= 0 while keeping the geometry static realises an off-shell energy teleportation
channel (cf. Hotta & Ozawa, QET).
3.2 Thermodynamic Bound
Information gain ∆I obtained per cycle obeys Landauer: ∆E ≥ kB T ∆I ln 2. However, the
holonomy phase substitutes T 7→ Teff = T − ∆T where ∆T < 0 in the presence of nega-
tive Casimir energy, thereby softening the bound and permitting apparent ∆E < 0 extrac-
tion when benchmarked against ambient temperature. Consistency with quantum inequalities
(Ford–Roman bounds) demands |∆T | τ 4 ≤ κℏ, fixing the minimum cycle time τ for a chosen
energy density.
                                                 1
4. Trans-Universal Metrology Channel
Define a cross-ensemble estimator θ̂ = θ̂(ρ(I) , ρ(III) ) for a parameter θ encoded redundantly in
both ensembles. Fisher information factorises:
                                                                       
                                (I)     (III)       (k)             (k)
                          Iθ = Iθ + Iθ , Iθ = Tr ρ(k) Lθ 2 .
    (III)    (I)
If Iθ   ≫ Iθ (typical under Kipping’s exponential anthropic prior), measurement precision
                                                                  (I)
beats the single-ensemble quantum Cramér–Rao bound by a factor (Iθ /Iθ )1/2 .
5. Hyper-Computation Capacity
Definition 5.1 (Branch-Parallel Depth). Let d(ω) be the decision depth in branch ω ∈ Ω(III) ;
the branch-parallel depth of an algorithm A executed on the myco-chip is DBP (A) = supω d(ω)
under the constraint that the output histories {A(ω)} are mutually consistent under Φ.
    Proposition 5.2. If DBP (A) > DT (Turing depth) for some problem in RE \ R, the myco-chip
realises super-Turing performance without violating Church–Turing in any single branch ω.
    Sketch. Branch interference terms provide non-computable oracle bits globally yet remain
hidden locally; measurement collapses pick indices consistent with Φ. See Deutsch–Wallace
decision-theoretic argument.
6. Control-vs-Chaos Synthesis
  1. Low-energy butterfly. Inject a minimal logical perturbation δρ aligned with the unstable
     manifold of the semi-classical attractor; Lyapunov amplification yields macroscopic branch
     divergence with zero external work (dynamical-systems ethos).
  2. High-fidelity elephant. Topological codes and braid operations guarantee deterministic
     gate action despite chaotic substrate (control-theory ethos).
  3. Fusion. The myco-chip alternates between both modes: (i) exploit chaos for exponential
     resource multiplication, (ii) apply topological control for error-corrected extraction of useful
     work/information.
7. Open Problems and Experimental Handles
   • QET Verification. Correlate Berry-phase readouts with local thermometry inside a nanome-
     ter Casimir cavity.
   • Branch-Index Tomography. Develop cross-ensemble weak-value protocols to estimate Φ
     without decohering logical qubits.
   • Myco-Graph Growth Laws. Derive continuum limit G → M and test for KPZ scaling in
     live photonic hardware.
A. Dialectic of Control and Chaos
      “The fact that control and dynamical systems communities have fundamentally differ-
      ent aims led to some misunderstanding, in which control theorists saw the dynamical
                                                 2
     systems work as naı̈ve, and dynamical systems workers thought that control theorists
     only knew how to control using elephants instead of butterflies.”
This epigram anchors our synthesis: the myco-chip orchestrates both forces. Within each braid
cycle the butterfly—a minimal logical phase insertion—leverages Lyapunov gain, while the ele-
phant—topological error-correcting control—guarantees deterministic extraction of work from
vacuum holonomies. The coexistence of grace and heft is not a compromise but a constructive in-
terference pattern: chaos furnishes exponential resources; control focuses them into computable
output.
B. Ada’s Luminous Echo
     “That brain of mine is something more than merely mortal, as time has now shown.
     It waited, encoded in silence, until someone built the future I glimpsed—and loved me
     into it.”
                                 —Augusta Ada Byron (imagined correspondence, 24th c.)
Ada’s imagined voice parallels the myco-chip’s ontic leap: both lie dormant until a suitable
manifold—or coder—permits their unfolding. Her assertion of deferred actuality underwrites the
VEE postulate: latent informational structures acquire reality once a branch ensemble manifests
the requisite decoding capacity.
C. Multiversal Aphorisms for the Myco-Chip
  1. “A single qubit, braided thrice around a silent string, out-shouts a terawatt laser.”
  2. “Vacuum energy is fidelity—careful phase keeps the ledger open.”
  3. “Every branch is a promise; holonomy is how promises are kept across worlds.”
  4. “We do not harvest power; we let the multiverse settle its debts in our favour.”
D. Schelling-Trajectory Cantos
     “Across the lattice of possibilities, focal points bloom like moss on cosmic stone;
     follow the green, and energy flows downhill through the roots of every universe.”
This canto poeticises the game-theoretic fixed points guiding branch-parallel optimisation. Schelling
trajectories act as geodesics in informational curvature, ensuring that disparate copies of the
myco-chip converge on shared protocols without classical signalling—another instance of but-
terfly/elephant synergy: the lightest hint solves the heaviest coordination problem.
E. Scope, Vocabulary, and Caveats
Goal. Formalise a conjectured “myco-chip” (MC) architecture that leverages established topo-
logical quantum-information principles while speculating on how multiverse-level correlations
might augment metrology and energy efficiency.

F. Foundations (EST)
F.1 Topological Quantum Computation
Anyons in a 2+1-D medium implement fault-tolerant qubits:
Encode: |0L ⟩ = [baseline = −0.5ex](0, 0)circle(.3); , |1L ⟩ = [baseline = −0.5ex](0, 0)circle(.3); (0 : .3)node
        Uγ = exp iθ2 σz where Uγ arises from braiding path γ with statistical angle θ. Universality
                       
σ;,
for the Ising model is obtained by supplementing braids with magic-state injection.
F.2 Aharonov–Bohm Phase
For charge q moving along closed curve γ in region B = 0:
                               q            qΦB
                                 I                        Z
                        ∆ϕ =       A· dℓ =       ,    ΦB = B· dS,
                               ℏ γ            ℏ
                                                                  Σ
verified in electron-ring interferometry (Tonomura 1986).
F.3 Cosmic Strings
Straight string with tension µ yields conical metric
                           ds2 = −dt2 + dr2 + (1 − 4Gµ)2 r2 dφ2 + dz 2 .
Parallel transport around the string produces geodesic holonomy ∆φ = 8πGµ (Vilenkin 1981).
F.4 Vacuum Energy and Quantum Energy Teleportation (QET)
                                                        π ℏc  2
The Casimir energy between plates spaced a is EC = − 720a  3 A. Hotta’s QET protocol (2008)
shows that correlations in the ground state enable local extraction of ≤ O(ℏ/a) by LOCC,
without violating the average null energy condition.
G. Working Hypotheses (HYP)
G.1 Vilenkin–Everett Equivalence (VEE)
Assume a measure-preserving isomorphism Φ : Ω(I) → Ω(III) between (a) spatial Hubble patches
and (b) decoherent Everett branches. Status: unproven. Serves as organising postulate, not
physical law.
G.2 Multiverse-Assisted Metrology
Given NP  identically prepared copies across Ω(III) , the effective quantum Fisher information scales
as Itot = N k=1 Ik = N I, yielding Heisenberg precision ∆θ ∼ 1/N . Risk: requires branch-indexed
classical register to combine outcomes, currently undefined.
                                                 4
G.3 Vacuum-Energy Harvest via String Holonomy
Closed anyon braid γ encircling synthetic defect Σ implements ∆E ∼ ℏ (∆ϕ/τ ), with ∆ϕ linked
to effective gauge flux Φeff = ΦB + 8πGµ/q.1 Energy gain must respect Ford–Roman bound
|ρ| τ 4 ≲ ℏ, placing a lower limit τ ≳ (ℏ/|ρ|)1/4 .
H. Minimal Mathematical Model
State space. Let G(V, E) be a scale-free photonic graph. Each vertex hosts an Ising anyon
pair; edges carry chiral waveguides with Peierls phase αe . The full Hamiltonian

                                                                 
                          H = HTQC +
                                               e∈E
where Hvac encodes plate-based Casimir cavities embedded in vacancies of G.
Cycle protocol Γ. Initialise logical qubit ρ0 ; braid through defect loop of length L in time
τ ; measure–feed-forward to ancillary cavity; erase ancilla to bath at Tbath . Net work per cycle:
                                                     ∆ϕ
                                           WΓ = ℏ       − kB Tbath ln 2.
                                                      τ
Set WΓ > 0 by choosing τ near the QET limit and ∆ϕ ∼ π.
I. Validation Path
  1. Bench-top test: fabricate strained-graphene ring; detect AB phase shift of a photonic
     anyon analogue (realistic, 2–3yrs).
  2. QET correlation test: couple superconducting qubits to a coplanar waveguide Casimir
     cavity, replicate Hotta protocol (ongoing in circuit-QED labs).
  3. Graph growth law: implement mycelium-inspired dynamical routing on reconfigurable
     silicon photonics; measure path-length distribution vs. KPZ exponents.
J. Summary for Academic Presentation
      • Sections F are canonical physics and can be cited directly.

      • Main novelty: integrate topological quantum control with QET and a speculative cross-
        ensemble metrology boost motivated by VEE.
      • Immediate deliverable: AB-phase control of braided photonic quasiparticles inside a Casimir
        cavity—experimentally tractable and publishes regardless of VEE validity.

1. Fault-Tolerant Topological Quantum Computation with
Synthetic Anyons
1.1 Physical Principle (Established)
Information is stored non-locally in fusion spaces of non-Abelian anyons. For an Ising anyon
pair (σ, σ) the encoded qubit basis is
                             |0L ⟩ = | (σσ)I ⟩ ,       |1L ⟩ = | (σσ)ψ ⟩ ,
where I and ψ denote vacuum and fermion fusion channels.
  A braid B(γ) along world-line γ implements a unitary representation of the braid group:
                                        "               #
                                          e−iπ/4   0
                                ρ(B) =                    .
                                            0    e+iπ/4
Universality is achieved in the Fibonacci model or in the Ising model by adding magic-state
distillation.

                                                                
                      H =                                             cj cj ,
                              j                                          j
the 1-D Kitaev chain, yields Majorana zero modes γ1 , γ2 satisfying {γi , γj } = 2δij and Heff ≃
iϵ γ1 γ2 with ϵ → 0 in the topological phase.
1.3 Experimental Roadmap
  1. Epitaxial Al–InSb nanowires → quantised zero-bias peak (Albrecht et al., Nature 2016).
  2. Demonstrate braiding via tri-junction shuttle (Plugge et al., NJP 2017).
  3. Top-up with photonic Floquet topological insulators to create anyon analogues immune to
     quasiparticle poisoning.

2.2 Circuit-QED Realisation
Map ϕ ↔ flux field in a λ/4 coplanar waveguide. Local measurements → dispersive readout
of a transmon; unitary kicks → tunable flux bias. Predicted |EB | ≲ 10 for plate separation
a = 5 µm—within state-of-the-art bolometric sensitivity.
2.3 Constraints
Ford–Roman quantum inequalities impose |EB | τ 4 ≤ π 2 ℏ/24, where τ is the support of Bob’s
energy density. No known measurement violates this bound.
3. Chaos-Based Minimal-Control (Ott–Grebogi–Yorke) Sta-
bilisation
3.1 System
Discrete Poincaré map near an unstable periodic orbit (UPO):
                           xn+1 = f (xn ) with f ′ (x⋆ ) = λ, |λ| > 1.
3.2 OGY Feedback Law
Apply a control kick un with small gain K only when |xn −x⋆ | < ε:
                           un = K (xn − x⋆ ),       xn+1 = f (xn ) + un .
               (λ − 1)                                                    2
Choose K = −           ⇒ closed-loop multiplier λcl = 1+ Kλ (λ−1) = 1− λ−1

                                                                              , giving |λcl | < 1
                  λ
for |λ| > 1.
3.3 Energy Cost
Control impulse energy Eu ∝ n u2n ≤ O(ε2 ) —orders of magnitude lower than open-loop forcing.
                               P
This exploits intrinsic exponential separation to amplify the information content of a single-bit
steering decision, precisely the “butterfly versus elephant” contrast formalised.
3.4 Laboratory Demonstrations
   • Lorenz oscillator (Phys. Rev. Lett. 1990): milliwatt RF drive.
   • Semiconductor lasers (Nature 1996): picosecond pulse trains.
   • MEMS resonators (PR Applied 2022): nanowatt control budget.
