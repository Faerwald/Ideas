Strange Loops as Symbolic Attractor Dynamics in Geometric Dynamical
Systems
We reformulate Douglas Hofstadter’s metaphorical concept of “strange loops”—used to explain recursion, self-
reference, consciousness, and emergence—using the rigorous mathematical language of geometric and high-
dimensional dynamical systems, specifically drawing from the frameworks developed in:
    • Geometrical Dynamics of Complex Systems (Ivancevic & Ivancevic, 2006)
    • High-Dimensional Chaotic and Attractor Systems (Ivancevic & Ivancevic, 2007)
    These frameworks allow us to re-encode Hofstadter’s cognitive and logical concepts in terms of manifold
theory, symbolic dynamics, jet bundle prolongation, topological chaos, and phase-synchronized attractor tran-
sitions.
1    Self-Reference as Fixed Points in Symbol-State Feedback Systems
Let X denote the high-dimensional state space of a cognitive, computational, or formal system. A symbolic
encoding map ϕ : X → Σ∗ translates system states into finite-length symbol strings, where Σ∗ is the free
monoid over a finite alphabet Σ.
    Let there also exist a decoding map M̃ : Σ∗ → X , such that the composition M̃ ◦ ϕ closes a feedback loop
on the system’s state space. A state x∗ ∈ X is self-representing if it satisfies the fixed point condition:
                                         x∗ = M̃ (ϕ(x∗ )) = (M̃ ◦ ϕ)(x∗ ).
    This is the formal analog of Gödel’s construction: a symbolically encoded object that encodes a statement
about itself. Symbolically, this corresponds to:
                                                T (ϕ(x∗ )) = ϕ(x∗ ),
    where T is an evolution operator on the symbolic space, such as a syntactic or semantic inference engine.
The existence of such a point corresponds to closure under meta-representation and is structurally equivalent
to the recursion theorem in logic or diagonal lemma constructions.
    Relevant machinery:
    • Jet prolongations over fibre bundles (Ch. 1.4, GDoCS)
    • Symbolic dynamics and Smale horseshoe codings (Ch. 2, HD-CAS)
    • Feedback symbolic automata on topological phase space
2    Strange Loops as Topologically Recursive Attractor Hierarchies
Strange loops are recursive traversals through abstraction layers which, after climbing a hierarchy of meta-
systems, return unexpectedly to the base level. Formally, let there exist a family of attractor sets {Ai } where
Ai ⊂ X denotes the attractor basin corresponding to abstraction level i.
    Define a mapping γ : Ai → Ai+1 representing abstraction, and suppose there exists k ∈ N such that:
                                                         1
                                                   γ k (Ai ) = Ai .
    Such a structure corresponds to a nontrivial cycle in the attractor transition graph, where a loop ascends
layers of interpretation or representation and eventually maps back onto its origin. These transitions can be
mediated via prolongation of jet bundles or via meta-system transitions embedded in control geometry.
    Relevant machinery:
    • Hierarchical attractors (Ch. 2.2, GDoCS)
    • Phase-synchronized recursive orbits (Ch. 5, HD-CAS)
    • Jet prolongation and gauge-symmetry transitions (Ch. 1.4, GDoCS)
3    Meaning as Persistence Across Symbolic and Geometric Scales
Hofstadter’s theory suggests that semantic meaning arises from stability and coherence of symbol structures
under recursive transformations. In dynamical systems, this corresponds to the persistence of symbolic cycles
and their embedding in topologically invariant structures (e.g., homology classes of closed orbits in X ).
    Let O ⊂ X be a closed orbit such that:
                                  T n (ϕ(x)) = ϕ(x),     for some x ∈ O, n ∈ N.
    Meaning corresponds to symbolic stability across abstraction levels and under noise perturbation, defined
via persistent homology or categorical invariants across jet bundle levels.
    Relevant machinery:
    • Symplectic and Kähler manifolds as symbolic-structure carriers (Ch. 1.2, GDoCS)
    • Path integrals over symbol-evolution trajectories (Ch. 1.5, GDoCS)
    • Control-invariant topological features (Ch. 2.3, GDoCS)
4    Distributed Selfhood and Collective Emergence
Hofstadter’s “Ant Fugue” implies that distributed agents can collectively instantiate an emergent “I” through
mutual symbolic reinforcement. In high-dimensional dynamical systems, this is modeled by phase synchroniza-
tion among nonlinear agents:
                                             (i)        (j)
                                   lim ∥ϕ(xt ) − ϕ(xt )∥ → 0,         ∀i, j ∈ N ,
                                   t→∞
                 (i)
    where each xt lies in the attractor basin of an individual agent and the symbolic dynamics ϕ(x) converge
across the network.
    Relevant machinery:
    • Multi-agent oscillatory phase models (Ch. 2.5, GDoCS)
    • Synergetic phase locking (Ch. 4, HD-CAS)
    • Solitonic structures in chaos fields (Ch. 9, HD-CAS)
                                                          2
5    Meta-System Transcendence and Jet-Theoretic Lifting
The act of “jumping out of the system”—a key moment in Hofstadter’s narrative—is modeled geometrically via
jet prolongation and gauge symmetry lifting. Let J k (E) denote the k-jet bundle over a base bundle E → M .
The lifting of differential relations to higher-order jets corresponds to the system entering a meta-description
space, akin to Gödel encoding meta-mathematical statements within arithmetic.
    This can also be modeled by transitions between gauge-equivalent structures, where a symmetry is broken
to permit semantic closure.
    Relevant machinery:
    • Jet bundle constructions and connections (Ch. 1.4, GDoCS)
    • Gauge-theoretic transitions in field models (Ch. 2.2, GDoCS)
    • Fractal and fractional layer transitions (Ch. 7, HD-CAS)

Conclusion
Hofstadter’s qualitative notion of the strange loop—a metaphor for the emergence of self through recursive self-
reference—can be rigorously modeled as a symbolic dynamical system embedded in a layered, high-dimensional
manifold. This manifold contains attractor basins and recursive homotopic cycles whose jet prolongations and
symbolic codings reflect the internal modeling of the system upon itself. Consciousness, under this formalism,
is a geometrically stable phase-locked attractor structure whose symbolic content recursively includes itself,
stabilized by dynamical feedback, encoding closure, and topological invariants.
