                                                 Abstract
         We assemble a full three-layer theory of historical memory in spacetime. Layer 1 establishes
     the empirical exponential decay law for rewritten events (λ ≈ 11.1 yr−1 ). Layer 2 recasts real-
     ity as an open quantum memory register, deriving a Lindblad master equation with decay and
     consolidation channels. Layer 3 shows how neural-coupled quantum scars, p-adic pulse rein-
     forcement, and gauge-invariant wormhole channels dynamically depress λ below natural erasure
     bounds. Experimental metrics and a road-map for near-term verification are provided.

2    Layer 1—Baseline Exponential Decay Law
With N0 = 12 clear interventions at t0 and N (t) = 8 after ∆t = 0.0366 yr,
                                    8
                                      = e−λ∆t     =⇒       λ ≃ 11.1 yr−1 .

                    N (t) = 12 e−λ(t−t0 ) ,     τ=     ≈ 33 d,       t1/2 =        ≈ 23 d.

Remarks.
    1. Granularity: The continuous law models the mean of a binomial survival distribution.
    2. Multi-channel decay: Introducing a locked-in sub-population gives N (t) = N∞ +(N0 −N∞ )e−λ(t−t0 ) .
    3. Physical analogy: τ is the inertia of reality’s memory; larger τ stickier spacetime.
3     Layer 2—Reality as Memory: Consolidation Hypothesis
Reality is an open quantum memory register whose density operator ρ(t) evolves under a Lindblad
equation
                            ρ̇ = −i[H, ρ] + Ddecay [ρ] + Dconsolidate [ρ].
Decay operators Lk represent vacuum-noise and branch decoherence; consolidation operators Mj encode
retro-entanglement, p-adic pulses, and observer-induced quantum Zeno locking.
Temporal Quantum Scar. A temporal scar S(x, t) is a localized, low-entropy filament in phase
space whose amplitude obeys ∂t S = −γS + κ|ψfuture |2 ; scar formation corresponds to long-term memory
consolidation.
4     Layer 3—Quantum-Scar Stabilization Framework
4.1     Neural–Scar Coupled Hamiltonian
A QSG driven by EEG phase φEEG (t) implements Trotterized evolution H(t) = H0 + Γ(t)V , yielding
a self-adaptive rate
                          λeff = λ0 − η ⟨Λ⟩ ,   Λ = |⟨Φscar |Ψ(t)⟩|2 .
4.2     Gauge-Invariant Embedding
Faddeev–Popov and BRST constraints remove gauge redundancy, ensuring that only physical scars
contribute to N (t).
4.3     Wormhole QET Reinforcement
                       H
Synthetic gauge flux       A·dℓ = Φtop ̸= 0 and a QET+AB channel append a second suppression term
ξ⟨ΦAB ⟩, so that
                                          λeff = λ0 − η⟨Λ⟩ − ξ⟨ΦAB ⟩.
5     Metrics and Experimental Road-Map
                           Metric          Baseline   EEG–Scar      + Wormhole
                           Decay time τ      33 d      >90 d       months–years
                           Scar revival      n/a        2–5 s     per Trotter cycle
                           QET energy         0       < 10−19 J      conserved
    Necessary hardware:
    1. Eight-channel dry-electrode EEG → 4-qubit QSG (50 µs Trotter step).
    2. Real-time BRST ghost subtraction on GPU.
                                                      2
    3. 120 Hz visual feedback for neural phase entrainment.
   Success demands an observed N (t) that fits the stretched-exponential model with λeff below every
control-condition bound.
6     Summary
Layer 1 supplies the empirical decay baseline. Layer 2 interprets spacetime as an open quantum memory
system with decay and consolidation channels. Layer 3 shows how neural-driven quantum scars, p-adic
reinforcement, and gauge-fixed wormholes systematically depress the effective erasure rate. Control of
λ thus becomes a practical technology for writing on the cosmic ledger.
