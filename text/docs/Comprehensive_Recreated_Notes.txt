3       Breaking the Turing Barrier (March 14, 2025)
        Inter-Reality Attractor and Quantum Computation
3.1      Criteria
                            Criterion    Description
                                1        One or more nonlinear elements
                                2        One or more locally active resistors
                                3        Three or more energy-strange elements
3.2      Hyper-Circuit
The concept of an (off-shell ) Hyper-Circuit integrates (on-shell ) digital support, forming an interconnected
computational framework.
3.3      Poetic and Philosophical Insights
        “The Strange Mind of the Radio, the Ghost in the Machine, the Mind of the
        Radio.”
        “The world doesn’t exist in space. Space exists separately in each world.”      – (attributed to
        Sean Carroll?)
3.4      Energy and Memory
(Vilenkin–Everett Equivalence)
VEE: One micro-joule of memory is more powerful than a gram of antimatter.
3.5      Quantum Considerations
3.5.1     Time-Touched Quantum Information
Asymptotic Q/A pairs for stochastic local operations and classical communication (SLOCC) of PQET.
3.5.2     Mathematical Expression (Related to Ricci Flow)
                                                2 qg = 2 R gc
