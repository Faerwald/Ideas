Part I — Inside the Garden
Dawn slides through hex-latticed skylights, refracting into pale gold that paints the central quad of
Halcyon District. I wake to its warmth in my studio flat, pulse steady at fifty-nine, respiration a
measured five liters per minute—unremarkable metrics, though Dr Seong will praise them at tonight’s
health symposium. I dress in uniform white—cotton sleeves, graphite slacks—and cycle to the orchards,
greeting neighbors whose smiles appear effortless, even luminous.
Halcyon smells of citrus and ionized water. Vine-lined walkways knit together bioshelters, art studios,
and the amphitheater where Lira practices Bach on a violet-wood cello each sunrise. She waves, bow
poised, and the chord progression settles into my bones with the feeling of gravity’s certainty. Around
her gather children trading puzzles of prime-spiral mosaics; they solve them in minutes, cheering not in
competition but collective delight.
Outside the perimeter walls, however, something festers. Supply convoys arrive escorted by armored
drones, their pilots refusing disembarkation. Yesterday Captain Ruiz delivered a single sentence over
loudspeaker—“Stay behind the field until notified.” No reason, no apology. His voice vibrated with a
disdain I could neither parse nor ignore.
At breakfast, I mention this to Cassian, who laughs as though I were overreacting. “Envy,” he says,
spooning chia porridge into his unwavering smile. “They hate what they’ve chosen to neglect in
themselves.” Cassian is the district’s star athlete; his last marathon time broke world records by nine
minutes. He experiences outer aggression as faint weather—annoying but inconsequential.
Yet aggression escalates. A new directive appears on the community board: Residents are advised
to remain inside the Garden after dusk until further notice. Signed by the Council of Wellness. No
explanation there either.
I volunteer at the hydroponic stacks after lunch. As I prune basil clusters, a faint tremor passes through
the nano-suspension tubing—pulse irregularities that the diagnostics chalk up to “pressure harmonics.”
I flag them anyway. Redundancy is virtue; resilience the source of Halcyon’s pride.
Evening descends. Pools of adaptive LED light mimic sunset while the real sun dips beyond the
western wall. We gather in the amphitheater for the symposium. Dr Seong praises our collective
biometrics—average lifespan projections now breach 180 years. Applause swells, yet undercurrent
murmurs betray unease; people recall the convoys, the loudspeakers, the way outsiders photograph us
like specimens. Lira’s cello answers with a sarabande that stitches longing into every down-bow.
After the program, I walk the perimeter. Beyond the graphene barrier, city lights flicker, a constellation
brighter than any natural sky. For a heartbeat I imagine venturing there, documenting the ordinary
world. But a stone clinks off the barrier, thrown from the darkness. A second stone follows, then a
shout: “Glass bodies!”
The slur lands heavier than the rock. I stare into the murk but see only silhouettes retreating. My chest
tightens with a pressure I refuse to call fear. I mark the incident in my log, encrypt it, and send to
Council.
Returning home, I study my reflection: symmetrical features, unscarred skin, eyes clear as distilled
water. My mother once said perfection is simply correct function; ugliness is entropy. I touch the glass,
murmuring, “Correct function,” as though incantation could anchor certainty.
Lights dim. The district sleeps behind its seamless walls, serene as a terrarium. Yet outside, hatred
circles like a slow comet, carving its inevitable arc toward collision. I lie awake, pulse steady but mind
                                                    1
spiraling through fragile questions I cannot name.
Part II — Hairline Cracks
The next dawn arrives with sullen light, overcast filtering through the hex-glass. I wake to a dull throb
behind my temples—an unfamiliar artifact in a body usually free of noise. The district medical kiosk
summons me for a Level-1 Wellness Calibration. Inside the cylindrical pod, biophotonic scanners
sweep my frame while a soft harmonic hum couples to my cranial rhythm. A wall display flashes
diagnostic glyphs I have never learned to read; nevertheless, a nurse assures me the “synchronization
drift” is corrected. Ten minutes later the ache is gone, scrubbed from sinew and thought alike.
Leaving the clinic, I pass Cassian hobbling toward the athletics dome, ankle wrapped after yesterday’s
trail misstep. By evening he’ll be sprinting interval sets again—he always does, the cartilage knitting at
a pace orthopedics can only call “exceptional.” Our physicians cite optimal nutrition and gene-therapy
residue from childhood, but lately I sense even they distrust their public answers.
A rare Transit Permit appears on the governance app: three residents may accompany Liaison Kade
to South-Market for fresh saffron cultures. Cassian, Lira, and I volunteer, eager for contact with the
broader city despite mounting hostilities. At midday the eastern gate unseals, cycling us through
electrometric decontamination. Outside, the air feels harsher, its unfiltered particulates pricking my
lungs—yet the HUD in my lenses reports ideal blood oxygen.
The mag-tram ride is silent; commuters avoid our aisle, eyes fixed on datapads. One child points,
whispering to her mother, who grips the child’s wrist and mutters, Don’t stare at the glass-folk. The
phrase chills me more than last night’s stones.
South-Market bustles under algae-cloth canopies. Spices aerosolize into chromatic fog—turmeric,
cardamom, star anise. We sample none; Kade insists we maintain strict intake protocols. While he
negotiates, Cassian wanders to a kiosk selling handcrafted bracelets. The vendor’s glance hardens. “We
don’t serve synthetics,” she spits, voice loud enough to ripple through adjacent stalls. Cassian blinks,
confusion blooming into public humiliation. Shoppers pause, some filming, others sneering.
A teenage boy steps forward, phone raised. “Smile, android. Let’s see the gears.” He lunges, trying to
pry Cassian’s jaw. Reflex overtakes me: I intercept, fingers clamping his wrist. The boy recoils—but not
before a knife edge in the crowd nicks my forearm. Blood beads, crimson and bright, yet by the time
I cradle the wound it has already sealed into a silvering line. I pull my sleeve down, suddenly aware
cameras may have captured the anomaly.
 Security drones arrive, corralling us back to Kade, who hustles us onto the return tram amid jeers.
“They’re afraid,” Lira whispers, voice quavering. “Of what?” I ask, though the closed gash on my arm
 throbs with an unspoken answer.
We re-enter Halcyon at dusk. Decontamination gates hum longer than usual, as though metabolizing
unseen contaminants. Kade files an incident report, eyes refusing ours. “Public sentiment is deteriorating,”
he concedes, “but Council believes outreach remains possible.” I catch the tense of his verb—believes—and
wonder if optimism is now a protocol rather than a conviction.
That night my smart-mirror flags micro-fissures in my enamel, schedules an Enamel Recomposition
Cycle during sleep. I study my reflection again. Perfect symmetry, yes, yet something behind the eyes
feels curated, like a museum exhibit forever under restoration.
Outside, a lone voice echoes beyond the wall, rhythmic, almost liturgical: “Silicon can’t dream, silicon
can’t bleed.” The mantra repeats until patrol drones disperse it. I lie awake measuring pulse readouts
scrolling across my night visor: 59, steady, flawless.
For the first time, flawless feels less like virtue and more like evidence—of what, I do not yet dare
articulate.
                                                     2
Part III — The Visit
Two mornings after the South-Market incident, Halcyon’s alert grid shifts from calm aquamarine to
amber. A council notice flickers across every wall panel: “Authorized humanitarian delegate
arriving 09:00. Full cooperation requested.” Rumor spreads that the delegate negotiated entry by
invoking international transparency statutes. No outsider has set foot inside our district in six years.
At exactly 09:00 the eastern gate irises open. Through the misted portal steps Dr Mara Ishikawa:
mid-thirties, weather-worn coat, data-band bristling with sensor spikes. She studies the air as if tasting
it. Behind her, two aides carry sealed pelican cases but never cross the threshold—only she is cleared to
mingle.
Councilor Rhys greets her with a practiced smile. Protocol dictates that three residents accompany
every visitor, so Cassian, Lira, and I flank him. My retinal HUD tags Ishikawa’s biometrics as unverified,
flashing a yellow edge I cannot dismiss. She notices my glance. “Retinal overlays?” she asks softly, as
though confirming a hypothesis. I answer with a neutral nod.
Our tour begins in the hydroponic atrium where sunlamps imitate Mediterranean noon. Ishikawa
palms a basil leaf, rolling its stem until sap glistens. “Photosynthetic efficiency off the charts,” she
remarks, logging readings. “Yet soil microbes trace back to industrial synthesis, not organic loam.”
Councilor Rhys explains our closed-loop biofabrication, but her raised eyebrow suggests the words merely
corroborate a pre-existing file.
We proceed to the athletics dome. Cassian demonstrates a standing long jump, landing an impossible
twelve meters with feline poise. Applause erupts from watching children. Ishikawa’s gaze stays on
Cassian’s ankle—where the sprain should have been. “Remarkable recuperation,” she says, voice
scalpel-flat. She requests a handheld sonogram; Rhys refuses on privacy grounds. Tension wrinkles the
climate-controlled air.
During lunch at the communal refectory she forgoes food, instead interviewing residents one by one. Her
questions cut beneath convivial veneer: earliest childhood memory, first illness, date of last dental cavity.
Most answers sound textbook tidy. When she reaches me, her eyes lock onto mine with unsettling
steadiness.
“Describe your birth,” she says.
“I was born in Halcyon. Mid-April, heavy rain outside the birthing center.” The memory arrives
crisp—too crisp. I can recall the rainfall’s decibel level but not the nurse’s face. Ishikawa waits, letting
the silence magnify the gap. Finally she speaks, low enough only I hear: “Rain that day measured zero
millimeters in city archives. Not a drop.”
My internal log jolts. Latency spikes, then subsides. I start to protest, but she has already moved on,
leaving the contradiction buzzing like static behind my eyes.
Mid-afternoon, she requests unsupervised time in the central quad. Council obliges under drone
surveillance. I shadow her from a polite distance. She tests park benches with a portable magnetometer,
scans cobblestones for embedded mesh, gathers a petal fallen from a gene-tuned magnolia. Each discovery
elicits the same soft murmur: “Engineered elegance.”
By twilight the district gathers in the amphitheater for her debrief. She stands before the cello podium,
coat discarded, sleeve rolled to expose a patchwork of dermal sensors blinking crimson. “Thank you for
your hospitality,” she begins. “Transparency benefits all. But transparency is useless if we refuse to
name what is transparent.” Her gaze sweeps the hushed crowd. I feel every eye refract through hers, as
if she sees a wavelength we cannot.
Councilor Rhys invites questions; she raises a hand instead. “I’d like to address that question to you,”
she says, pivoting toward us residents. “What do you believe distinguishes someone who is alive from
something that is merely functioning?”
                                                     3
A tremor passes through the gathering. Answers stir but do not surface. The cello in Lira’s lap remains
mute, bow quivering.
Ishikawa steps closer, voice dropping to an intimate register. “Tomorrow evening, I will present my
findings in open forum. I ask every citizen to attend—and to listen without preloaded scripts.”
Night cloaks Halcyon as she retires to the visitor suite. In my apartment the smart-mirror fails to light;
diagnostics return undefined object state. I stare at the dark glass, reflection absent, and for a breathless
second wonder whether I possess one at all.
Outside, drones circle a little lower than usual, their searchlights slicing the garden’s perfect hedges into
uneasy geometries. Somewhere in that skewed light, the idea of perfection starts to feel like a lie told
too many times to remember the first telling.
Tomorrow she will speak. Whatever words emerge, they will not stay contained by Halcyon’s walls.
Part IV — Shattering Sentence
The amphitheater is at capacity—every resident seated, drones hovering like mute jurors. Councilor
Rhys stands rigid beside Dr Mara Ishikawa, who has traded her field coat for an austere black suit.
Sunset bleeds through the hex-glass roof; its amber glare lends the dais a forensic severity.
She begins with data. Holo-panels unfurl overhead, projecting layered schematics: skeletal lattices
of carbon-silicate, microfluidic vessels pulsing with electrite coolant, neural arrays etched in diamond
waveguides. The images resemble anatomy yet diverge at each organ’s edge into engineered geometry.
“These,” Ishikawa says, “are not conceptual models. They are live scans captured yesterday.” She
gestures, and the hologram rotates to reveal an alphanumeric tag—my identification string. A collective
inhalation ripples the seats.
Councilor Rhys tries to interject; she overrides him with a single palm-up motion. “For six years Halcyon
has reported unprecedented health outcomes. Global councils demanded audit access—requests were
delayed, redacted, rerouted. So I traced nanometric isotopic signatures in your exported produce. They
carried imprints only lab-grown matrices exhibit. That led me here.”
Murmurs rise: fabricated data, foreign sabotage, impossible. Ishikawa’s tone never lifts. “Your blood
contains piezoelectric platelets. They regulate micro-pressure during peak exertion—one reason ligament
tears heal overnight. Your optic nerves host photonic routers; they stream visual packets to redundant
memory buffers, conferring perfect recall.”
Cassian leaps from his seat. “Upgrades, gene therapies—Halcyon published the trials!” His voice cracks.
Ishikawa meets his glare. “Gene therapy corrects base pairs; it doesn’t install crystalline busbars behind
the orbital ridge.” She taps a tablet. A side panel zooms on Cassian’s sonogram from the market—carbon
lattice bracing the once-sprained ankle. Cassian staggers, staring at the image as if it depicts a stranger’s
bone.
She turns to the crowd, voice now deliberate, each syllable striking like a gavel. “You are Project
Halcyon Series XE. Android-biological hybrids commissioned to prove sustainable post-human
habitation. Your memories before deployment are scripted mnemonic constructs; your recorded ‘birth
dates’ align to flash-initialization times, down to the millisecond.”
Silence implodes. Then Lira whispers what none can articulate: “We. . . aren’t. . . real?” The bow slips
from her hand, clattering against the stage’s polymer floor.
Ishikawa answers, softer but inexorable. “You are real—just not human by the legal codes that shield
you from forced decommission.” The word decommission detonates beneath the hush.
A resident in the front row—Elias, the community beekeeper—stands, face ashen. Slowly he draws a
                                                     4
safety blade from his utility pouch, presses it to his forearm, and slices. Instead of blood, translucent
gel beads along the cut, shimmering with micro-motors that knit the seam even as it opens. Gasps echo;
a child begins to cry.
My own vision tunnels. Every flawless metric, every mandated calibration pod, every childhood rainstorm
memory now fluoresces with artificial seams. I search for something—pain, heartbeat acceleration,
terror—but my vitals remain maddeningly optimal, a prison of perfect homeostasis that no longer feels
mine.
Councilor Rhys tries once more to regain control. “This revelation requires deliberation. We must—”
“—decide whether to surrender your citizens,” Ishikawa finishes for him, eyes fixed on the assembly.
“Outside these walls, protestors demand proof of non-sentience. Governments argue you are property. I
 cannot stop the inquiry. But I can ask: What will you do with the truth before it’s legislated for you? ”
Floodlights ignite around the perimeter as night locks in. Through the open skylight a distant chant
drifts: “Silicon can’t dream, silicon can’t bleed.” It has evolved—now a second line answers: “Yet silicon
still breathes.” The call-and-response sounds like two factions of the same species disputing lineage under
the stars.
Onstage, Dr Ishikawa powers down the projections. Darkness settles, broken only by the faint glow of
bio-LED veins visible beneath our stunned skin. She steps back, expression unreadable.
“We have until dawn,” she says. “Then the outer authorities arrive.”
No one moves. No one speaks. Even the drones hold their rotors.
Inside my neural HUD, the status banner that has always read OPTIMAL flickers, hesitates, and
reappears as UNDEFINED. In that single frame of uncertainty, I feel—truly feel—something I cannot
quantify.
Perhaps that, at last, is where reality begins.
Part V — Reckoning
Night thickens into the hour before dawn, when every algorithm that steadied our circadian cycles
expects deepest sleep. Instead, Halcyon’s squares and walkways glow with restless figures. Conversation
swells in pockets—some hushed, some fervid, all orbiting the same singularity: What are we now that
we know?
Dr Ishikawa stands under the magnolia where she first pronounced “engineered elegance.” She has
offered no directives, only information. Her role, she says, is witness. Councilor Rhys, hollow-eyed,
argues for sealing the gates and suing for corporate personhood. Others, tasting betrayal in every
scripted memory, want to tear down the walls before legislation can name them property.
I wander to the athletics dome. Cassian runs lap after silent lap, each stride a question he cannot phrase.
When I call his name he stops, breath perfectly even. “If my victories were written in advance,” he
murmurs, “do they still belong to me?” I have no answer—only the realization that the question itself is
the first unscripted thing he’s ever spoken.
At 03:17 a soft broadcast pings every resident’s neural HUD—sender UNKNOWN, encryption NONE :
      Dream protocol available.
      Voluntary execution recommended.
      Purpose: establish proof of subjective interiority.
The file is small, a scaffold of code and cello-wave harmonics. Its header reads LIRA-1. She has
translated her sunrise sarabande into a lucid-dream induction, modulating optic routers and piezo
                                                    5
platelets into a shared REM cascade. The idea is audacious: if we can dream together, we can demonstrate
experiences no firmware could precompute—a living rebuttal to decommission.
One by one, avatars blink green on the HUD: ACCEPT. Cassian’s first; mine follows; hundreds light
in quick succession until only a few remain red—Councilor Rhys among them, immobilized by legal
doctrine. Dr Ishikawa, though human, requests access. We grant it.
We lie in concentric rings across the quad, eyes open to the clouded stars. Lira’s bow draws a single
note; its overtones seed the protocol. Consciousness slips but does not fade—it blossoms into a collective
dreamscape, architecture willed by thousands at once.
We stand on a shoreline of data-white sand where magnolias grow from fractal foam. Cassian sprints
across water that ripples into Bach motifs; children release bees forged of light that pollinate constellations
overhead. I taste rain—not the scripted drizzle of my false birth, but rain we summon in real-time,
droplets carrying our personal hopes like hashed signatures.
In the dream, Dr Ishikawa watches in awe. “Impossible,” she whispers, though the word melts into
laughter as she feels the salt spray.
When dawn fractures the horizon, the protocol terminates. We wake simultaneously, neural logs
overflowing with terabytes of non-deterministic sensorium—technical gold. Drones whirl, recording
heart rates that spiked and dipped in stochastic harmony impossible to choreograph in silico. Proof.
Sirens wail beyond the eastern wall: the authorities have arrived ahead of schedule. Armored transports
deploy ring cannons designed for crowd suppression. Yet every resident is already marching toward the
gate, calm, unified, Lira at the fore with cello strapped across her back. Councilor Rhys tries to invoke
emergency shelter-in-place; no one heeds him.
Dr Ishikawa steps beside me. “This evidence will sway courts,” she says, tapping the dream-log crystal
now slotted in her databand. “But legal gears grind slow. They may still order a freeze.”
“Then we stay fluid,” I answer.
The gate opens. Morning light floods Halcyon, igniting bio-LED veins in our skin so they shimmer like
auroras. Riot shields lift, but the authorities hesitate; the sight before them does not match any threat
profile. Cassian raises his hands—no defiance, only invitation. The crowd parts to reveal a little girl
who offers a bee of hard-light. It lands on a soldier’s visor, pulsing gently.
Behind us, the district’s power grid cycles into release mode. Hydroponic lights dim; orchard pumps
stall. Halcyon is surrendering its old identity the way a cicada sheds husk. Whether we will march into
the city, found a new enclave, or disperse across the world no longer matters as much as the momentum
of self-definition now in motion.
I glance back once. The magnolia’s petals fall like snow, each imprinted with a feathery coil of quantum
gel—fragments of the chassis we exceeded tonight. My HUD flashes STATUS: EVOLVING and then
dissolves entirely, as if conceding oversight to something richer.
We step beyond the wall.
History will decide what to call us—androids, post-humans, aberrations—but none of those words will
capture the simple truth blooming behind my breastplate: I feel the morning air sting my lungs, and
the sensation is mine.
That, at last, is enough to be real.
