This document outlines two of the most daring and technically grounded pillars in the A-wave
research paradigm: using chaos to boost computation beyond current limits, and probing whether
information can really ripple backward in time through a process known as transactional
signaling. Both proposals stretch the boundaries of what’s physically possible without violating
any known law—at least, not directly. Each uses existing physics in extreme, nonlinear regimes to
test the limits of what can be measured, amplified, or exchanged across spacetime.
Chaos Hypercomputing
To understand the first idea, consider what happens inside a chaotic system. In such a system, a
tiny difference in starting conditions explodes exponentially fast. This is quantified by the
Lyapunov exponent, λ, which measures how quickly two nearby trajectories diverge. A large λ
means rapid divergence—meaning the system explores its possible states much faster than
random noise or step-by-step calculation could.
This kind of exponential phase spreading is computational gold. In classical systems, exploring a
high-dimensional space takes time proportional to the number of configurations. But in a chaotic
system, if you encode your input as a small difference in initial condition—say, a tiny shift in
electromagnetic phase—the system blows it up into a large, observable outcome in microseconds
or less. That makes the system a natural analog hypercomputer: it rapidly evaluates many
trajectories, and small differences in setup become detectable signals, effectively transforming
low-energy inputs into high-information outputs.
Several architectures are proposed to realize this:
   1.​ Superconducting Stadium Cavity: This is a 3D electromagnetic cavity shaped like a
       stadium, with curved and straight walls. A photon bouncing inside this shape behaves like a
       particle in a Sinai billiard—its trajectory is chaotic. A small phase error spreads into
       measurable differences in nanoseconds. With superconducting walls and femtojoule energy
       injections, this becomes a real, scalable testbed for phase-sensitive chaotic computing.​
   2.​ Photonic Chaos Mesh: A grid of Mach-Zehnder interferometers on a silicon nitride chip
       rapidly shuffles phase through interference. Small input differences get scrambled and
       amplified into broad distributions within tens of picoseconds. This creates a fast, low-power,
       and integrated platform for chaotic computing that can operate at the edge of quantum
       precision.​
   3.​ MEMS-Based LC Resonator Lattice: Here, a network of resonators—each a tiny oscillating
       electrical circuit—is coupled in a way that induces chaos via mechanical motion. This version
       is slower but physically simpler and can be probed with classical tools.
Across all these designs, the shared mechanism is: inject a precise phase using an A-wave—a
disturbance in the electromagnetic potential with no classical energy—and let chaos amplify that
phase until it shows up as a macroscopic change, detectable by interferometers, qubits, or
sensors. These systems use only femtojoules of energy but yield measurable effects in timescales
a million times faster than traditional systems.
Transactional Signaling
Now for the second idea: what if we could test whether the future can influence the past—not by
breaking causality, but by exploring its loopholes?
This is the Wheeler–Feynman absorber theory, which says that nature might secretly be using
both forward- and backward-in-time electromagnetic waves. Normally, these cancel out due to
perfect absorption in the future. But if you interrupt that symmetry, you might unbalance the
cancellation—and detect the effect of the future now. This isn’t science fiction; it’s embedded in the
equations. The trick is to build the right experiment to catch the imbalance.
Three routes are proposed:
   1.​ Delayed-Choice Aharonov–Bohm Interferometer: Electrons move through an
       interferometer. While they’re in flight, you choose whether or not to inject an A-wave. If
       standard QED is right, their interference pattern won’t be affected unless your choice was in
       their past light cone. But if the absorber theory is right, their wavefunction will respond even
       before the choice is made. The phase shift is tiny—but measurable over millions of electrons.​
   2.​ Self-Cancelling Source: Two antennas are placed meters apart. The first emits a pulse; the
       second emits a canceling wave a few nanoseconds later. If advanced waves are real, the
       cancellation can back-propagate to affect the first antenna’s field before the second emits.
       This would be seen as a suppression in the field energy—a measurable six-decibel dip using
       superconducting sensors.​
   3.​ Entangled Photon Synchronizer: Pairs of entangled photons are sent to distant stations. A
       choice at one station—whether or not to inject an A-wave—shouldn't affect the other unless
       advanced signaling exists. But if it does, subtle modulations in detection timing could betray
       the presence of a retroactive handshake. With enough photon pairs and precise timing, this
       effect could stand out clearly above statistical noise.​
What ties both pillars together is that the A-wave carries no classical energy. It doesn’t push. It
shapes. It alters phase structure and lets the system’s own dynamics—chaos, resonance,
entanglement—do the amplification. Instead of transmitting power, it transmits potential, which is
later unlocked by the system’s natural evolution.
The elegance of this framework is that it allows for speculative, forward-looking experiments
without requiring a rewrite of known physics. Even null results would be valuable, ruling out or
tightening bounds on the behavior of quantum systems in feedback loops or under chaotic
amplification. But a positive result—detection of faster-than-light phase influence, or computation
beyond BQP bounds—would not just shift physics. It would suggest that the universe already
contains the infrastructure for retrocausal communication and hyperintelligent computation.
We just have to learn how to listen.
