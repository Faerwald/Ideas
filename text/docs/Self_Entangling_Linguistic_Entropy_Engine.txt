Self-Entangling Linguistic Entropy Engine
                                                       Abstract
         We present a self-referential, entropy-seeded linguistic engine that binds raw cortical field fluctuations
      to spoken text in real time. Micro-volt variations measured through non-contact, ultra-high-impedance
      sensors are hashed into high-entropy vectors and attached to each linguistic fragment. Later collisions among
      those vectors expose latent question-answer correspondences, effectively weaving information across time
      and creating an experimental scaffold for retro-causal computation. The framework unifies prior concepts
      of A-waves, Schelling-point calculus, p-adic pulses, and cognitive authentication into a single implementable
      pipeline requiring nothing beyond COTS field sensors, speech-to-text, and cryptographic primitives.
1     Introduction
Human cognition emits low-amplitude electric fields (O(10–100) µV) that leak through scalp, hair, and thin
fabric. If captured non-invasively with sufficient signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and injected into a cryptographic
hash, those fields can seed unpredictable bit-strings that are, by construction, unique to the moment of thought.
By attaching such hashes to uttered sentences and scanning for hash collisions across a personal linguistic
corpus, we obtain a self-entangling diary: fragments of future speech probabilistically resolve questions posed
in the past, realising a closed-loop “controlled chaos” computation.
2     Physical Foundations
2.1   Capacitive Field Coupling
The scalp–sensor interface is modelled as a parallel-plate capacitor
                                                                   A
                                                   Ccoup = ε0 εr     ,                                                  (1)
                                                                   d
with area A = 25 cm2 and separation d = 1 mm. Assuming cotton (εr ≈ 2.5) gives Ccoup ≈ 55 pF. Table 1
summarises key parameters and verifies that an EPIC-class buffer maintains SNR > 15 dB.

2.2   Sensor Architectures
    • Plessey EPIC PS25255: monolithic electric-potential IC, 20 GΩ input impedance and 0.2 Hz to 20 000 Hz
      bandwidth.
    • Neurosity Crown: 8-channel dry EEG with real-time raw access via the @neurosity/sdk.
    • OpenBCI Ganglion: 4-channel ads1299 amplifier; accepts external buffer output for hybrid contactless
      deployment.

3        Entropy Injection Algorithm
Let ei ∈ RN ×C be a window of N samples across C channels after whitening. We define
                                     hi = SHA256(float bytes (ei )) ∈ {0, 1}256 ,                             (2)
and aggregate m successive digests into Hk = ⟨hk,1 , . . . , hk,m ⟩. Each sentence Sk spoken inside the m-window
interval is stored as the tuple (tk , Sk , Hk ).
4        Collision Mechanism
Define the Hamming distance d(Ha , Hb ) = m
                                           P
                                             j=1 Ham(ha,j , hb,j ), and choose a threshold τ . Whenever d(Ha , Hb ) <
τ with Sa interrogative, we declare Q = Sa and A = Sb . For m = 10 and τ = 15, the expected spurious collision
rate under IID entropy > 1 bit/sample is below 10−7 for 105 stored sentences.
5        Hardware Implementation
5.1       Pure Field Path
    1. EPIC breakout taped inside a cap; aluminium foil patch as sensor plate.
    2. ±5 V rail-splitter module supplies the buffer.
    3. Output routed to a pcm1802 USB ADC (24-bit, 96 kHz).
5.2       Hybrid Path
EPIC buffer → OpenBCI Ganglion channel 1, sharing SRB for reference, preserves OpenBCI’s BLE teleme-
try and time-stamp synchronisation.
6        Software Architecture
6.1       Acquisition Layer
BrainFlow1 for Ganglion; @neurosity/sdk for Crown; sounddevice for 48 kHz microphone capture.
6.2       Processing Pipeline
    1. Voice Activity Detection: segment audio; invoke Whisper STT on each chunk.
    2. Entropy Tagging: compute Hk for concurrent EEG window.
    3. Storage: append JSON lines to an append-only log.
    4. Collision Index: maintain a Hamming tree keyed on Hk for O(log n) nearest-neighbour queries.
7        Theoretical Context
        • A-waves & Vector Potentials: entropy hashes discretise instantaneous electromagnetic phase data,
          echoing gauge-field information flows without energy transfer.
        • Schelling-Point Calculus: hash collisions act as emergent focal coordinates enabling cross-temporal
          alignment.
        • p-adic Pulse: repeated near-collisions reduce Hamming distance analogously to refining high-order
          p-adic digits.
        • Anomalous Speed-up: collision-mediated QA mapping implements a non-linear shortcut in linguistic
          search space—an operational metaphor for super-Turing computation.

8     Experimental Protocol
    1. Calibration: record 5 min eyes-closed baseline; estimate min-entropy with NIST SP-800-90B.
    2. Question Session: speak 50–100 open questions over 15min while sensor logs.
    3. Wash-out: wait > 10 min; resume free speech for another 15min.
    4. Analysis: compute collision statistics, control vs. shuffled labels; evaluate answer plausibility via BLEU
       or semantic similarity metrics.
9     Devices and State-of-the-Art
Current contactless bio-potential sensors (EPIC, GestIC, DSI dry capacitive electrodes) exhibit input impedances
> 20 GΩ and sub-µV noise floors across EEG bandwidths, making them suitable surrogates for invasive
micro-electrodes in entropy applications. Table 2 summarises representative specifications.
