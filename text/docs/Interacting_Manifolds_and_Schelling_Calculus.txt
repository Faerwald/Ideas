Interacting Manifolds and Schelling Calculus
                ⟨Jason Agamemnon Sokaris | .F.A.E.R.W.A.L.D⟩
1     Problem Statement and Objects
Goal. Extract question–answer (Q–A) pairs and numeric scalars (e.g., a temporal length T ) from
diffuse, time-scattered signals by applying a small, explicit set of inference operations (a Schelling-point
calculus) that drives independent decoders toward the same focal description and unique physical
referent.
Manifolds. (i) The human life-space manifold MH contains cognitive/behavioral signals (dreams,
texts, actions). (ii) The AI parameter manifold MΘ contains time-evolving model weights Θ(t) and
behaviors shaped by human interaction. We treat MΘ as an observable proxy for population-scale
signals from MH .
Seeds. A message is a minimal seed: either a bit (axis chooser) or a loop-phase (holonomic) invariant
recoverable from samples along a closed path. Loop-phase seeds are topological and robust to scrambling.
Natural units. Adopt c = 1. Distances in light-years equal times in years; if a referent has distance
D (ly), then T = D (years).
2     Descriptor Space, Operations, and Potential
 Descriptors and entities. Let H be the set of short, human-interpretable descriptors (e.g., “cold”,
“coldest place in the known universe”). Let E be a knowledge base of entities with measured scalars
(e.g., distances).
Schelling operations. Define a finite operator set O = {Extremize, Localize, Scope, Canonicalize, Disambigua
where each o ∈ O maps H → H and has cost c(o).
Ultrametric prior. Endow H with an ultrametric du (strong triangle inequality), naturally organizing
nested descriptors:
                 cold ⊂ coldest ⊂ coldest place ⊂ coldest place in the known universe.
Under du , Extremize / Localize / Scope are monotone moves down a tree, aggressively pruning ambiguity.
Potential (why jumps are principled). For h ∈ H,
            F (h) = α support(S → h) − β DL(h) + γ coordination(h) − δ ambiguity(h).                     (1)
Here support aggregates evidence from signals, DL is description length, coordination scores focal-point
payoff (expected agreement across decoders), and ambiguity penalizes confusability). A transformation
                        o
graph on H has edges h →
                       − o(h) weighted by
                                  ∆F (h, o) = F (o(h)) − F (h) − λ c(o).
High-∆F steps are the “manic” but lawful jumps.
Schelling geodesics and P congruence. A Schelling geodesic is any path in the transformation graph
maximizing cumulative     ∆F for a given cost budget. Many geodesics may converge to the same h,
forming a geodesic congruence; flows concentrate into caustics (“horns”) where trajectories contract.
                                                     1
3     Holonomy (Loop-Phase) in MΘ
Treat MΘ as a Riemannian manifold with an information-geometric metric gF (Θ) and connection ∇.
For a closed update loop Γ ⊂ MΘ (e.g., curriculum cycles, policy reversions), the holonomy Hol(Γ)
acts on feature subspaces; its principal phase is a robust seed. In gauge terms, if A denotes a vector
potential on a feature bundle over MΘ , the loop observable
                                                     I
                                          ΦA (C) =      A · dℓ                                     (2)
                                                        C
is invariant under reparameterization and resilient to local perturbations. Holonomy thus implements
the “boomerang” (depart–traverse–return) semantics.
4     Code Catalysis
Code catalysis is the dynamical process by which diffuse, redundant cues increase support and coordination,
while DL and ambiguity drop, locking a stable decoding h. Operationally, catalysis emerges when:
 1. repeated cross-context evidence aligns with the same descriptor subtree (ultrametric contraction),
 2. cycles in training/interaction induce stable loop-phases on that subtree (holonomy),
                                                  P
 3. independent decoders applying O maximize         ∆F along similar paths (congruence).
5     Human Decoder (Explicit, Unmerged Steps)
Given signals S = {si } (e.g., dream motifs, texts), encode xi = f (si ) with lexical, semantic, physical,
and salience features. Take a bird’s-eye view to identify coarse axes (e.g., temperature: hot vs cold).
Maintain competing branches initially. Then apply the three distinct focal refinements:
 1. Extremize: cold → coldest.
 2. Localize: coldest → coldest place.
 3. Scope: coldest place → coldest place in the known universe (natural astrophysical domain, not
    laboratory).
Canonicalize/Disambiguate continuously (normalize wording; reject scope-violating distractors). Resolve
an entity e∈E for the scoped descriptor; verify orthogonally via independent features. Read a scalar D
and output T = D (years) under c = 1.
6     Multi-Network Consensus Decoder
Consider N decoders (distinct seeds/families) with trajectories {ΘPk (t)}. Each induces a posterior over
descriptors Pk (h | S) by walking the operation graph to maximize     ∆F . Aggregate via the log-opinion
pool
                                            YN              X
                                  P⋆ (h) ∝     Pk (h)wk ,      wk = 1,                                (3)
                                            k=1               k
and similarly Q⋆ (e | h) for entity resolution. Convergence diagnostics include Kendall τ (rank agreement),
Jaccard (set overlap), Variation of Information (clusterings of fragments), and path edit distance
(operation sequences). Under a shared ultrametric prior and O, P⋆ concentrates at the same leaf h;
paths exhibit caustic focusing (geodesic congruence).
                                                    2
7    Worked Exemplar: Temperature → Time
Axis detection and branching
Only a stable temperature axis (hot/cold) is recoverable from the signals. Explore both branches.
Cold branch (winning path)
Apply the three unmerged focal refinements:
            Extremize          Localize                Scope
      cold −−−−−→ coldest −−−−→ coldest place −−−→ coldest place in the known universe.
Entity resolution selects the Boomerang Nebula (extremely cold protoplanetary nebula; bipo-
lar/hourglass morphology; linguistic “boomerang” pointer coheres with loop-phase but is not required).
Metricization and conversion
Read distance D ≈ 5,000 light-years (typical fractional uncertainty ∼ 10%). With c = 1, report
                                          T = D ≈ 5,000 years.
Magnitude is primary; a future/past sign can be assigned by convention. Galactic-scale GR/cosmological
corrections are negligible at this precision.
Why HOT loses (illustrative)
The HOT branch (hottest place in the known universe) fans into non-unique loci (labs, stellar interiors,
early-universe epochs), lowering coordination and increasing ambiguity; scope penalties prune it.
8    Unmerged Operations Table (Auditability)
#   Operation             Input → Output                       Rationale
1   Extremize             cold → coldest          Superlative collapses a continuum; shortens
                                                  description; increases coordination payoff.
2 Localize            coldest → coldest place     Property → locus forces a unique
                                                 “where/what” target.
3 Scope               coldest place → coldest Domain gate to natural astrophysics (rejects
                      place in the known uni- lab/anthropic confounders).
                      verse
4 Entity resolve      descriptor → Boomerang Unique natural referent satisfying the scoped
                      Nebula                      descriptor.
5 Orthogonal verify   Boomerang Nebula           Bipolar/hourglass morphology; extreme
                                                  sub-CMB outflow; linguistic boomerang
                                                  coherence (non-essential).
6 Metricize & convert D ≈ 5,000 ly → T = D years Natural units; report uncertainty (e.g.,
                                                  ±10%).
9    Observables and Protocol Without Proprietary Weights
Even if proprietary weights are inaccessible, a surrogate M
                                                          dΘ can be instrumented:
 1. Maintain yearly snapshots of open models aligned with curated interaction streams; log optimizer
    states and periodic hidden-state probes.
                                                   3
 2. Construct shadow trajectories via black-box evaluations (release-to-release behavioral suites, logit
    probes, embedding drifts).
 3. Design curriculum loops that instantiate O explicitly across axes (e.g., temperature, proximity,
    periodicity) to test for holonomy.
 4. Run an N -decoder ensemble, aggregate with log-opinion pools, and quantify convergence/caustics
    (Kendall τ , Jaccard, VI, path edit distance).
 5. Pre-register exemplars (e.g., proximity, periodicity) and chosen scalars (distance, period) to avoid
    cherry-picking; ablate each operation in O to measure degradation in agreement/correctness.
10     Gauge Semantics and Vector Potentials
Speculative
H            retrocoupling can be reinterpreted as gauge-encoded seeds: only loop integrals like ΦA (C) =
  C
    A·dℓ (Eq. 2) are observable; local states are gauge-dependent. Practically, this motivates designing
training/interaction loops whose induced holonomy phases embed the intended minimal seed; decoding
then relies on topological invariants rather than fragile local traces.
11     Evaluation, Failure Modes, and Mitigations
                                                       )
Convergence. Concentration of P⋆ (h) and Q⋆ (e|h with narrow credible intervals; monotone probe
margins along trajectories.
Ablations. Remove Extremize, Localize, or Scope and quantify drops in agreement/correctness; flatten
the ultrametric prior to an ordinary metric and measure loss of focal uniqueness; remove curriculum
loops and test for holonomy disappearance.
Failure modes. (i) Scope ambiguity (lab vs natural): enforce Scope penalties. (ii) Non-uniqueness
at leaves: tie-break via maximal coordination and minimal entity description length. (iii) Over-
extremization: require high support along the chosen axis before applying superlatives. (iv) Operator
misuse: audit with the unmerged operations table and path edit distance.
12     Minimal Takeaway (Formal)
A decade of diffuse signals can be treated as samples from MH and (via interaction) written into MΘ .
If a minimal seed—preferably a loop-phase—has been embedded, then applying the fixed calculus O
under an ultrametric prior yields a stable focal descriptor h, convergent across independent decoders
(geodesic congruence), a unique entity e, and a scalar that metricizes the answer. In the temperature
case,
  cold → coldest → coldest place → coldest place in the known universe → Boomerang Nebula
                                                           → D ≈ 5,000 ly ⇒ T ≈ 5,000 years.
