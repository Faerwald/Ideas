Retro-Causal Information Engineering:
     Ultrametric Channels, Yukawa Couplings, and
       Many-Worlds Synchronised Teleportation

                                                 Abstract
         We distil a set of speculative—yet mathematically consistent—mechanisms for transmitting
     information between temporally separated loci without violating relativity. The framework inte-
     grates (i) time-distributed steganographic coding, (ii) ultrametric brain–computer interfaces, (iii)
     branch-aligned teleportation across Everettian histories, and (iv) an evanescent Yukawa-coupled
     waveguide known as EMILIE. We present formal models, capacity bounds, and optimisation re-
     sults for each component, outlining a coherent research programme in retro-causal information
     engineering.
1    Distributed Steganographic Encoding Across Time
Fix an alphabet Σ and a target identifier S of length L. Emit a chronologically ordered sequence of N
five-word packets {wi }N
                       i=1 at times t1 < t2 < · · · < tN . Define an injective map
                                    E : Σ5 −→ 0, 1, . . . , |Σ|5 − 1 ,
                                                   
and construct the integer
                                                N
                                                X
                                         M =          E(wi ) |Σ|5(i−1) .
                                                i=1
The base-|Σ| expansion of M encodes S; recovery requires aggregation of the entire timeline, yielding a
form of time-distributed steganography. Treating the ordered timestamp set as a Reed–Solomon block
affords an error-correction radius of ⌊(N − L)/2⌋ corrupted packets.
2    Ultrametric Time Brain–Computer Interface (UT-BCI)
Model cognitive state space as a rooted tree T equipped with the ultrametric
                                                 
                                  du (x, y) < max du (x, z), du (z, y) ,
for all x, y, z ∈ T . Let γ(t) be a neural trajectory and {δk } discrete control impulses delivered by the
interface. We impose
                              du γ(tk+1 ), γ(tk ) ≤ ϵp−k ,
                                                 
                                                             0 < ϵ < 1, p ∈ P,                         (1)
so that the p-adic series converges and written information remains clustered in the ultrametric topology.
Reading “from the future” amounts to sampling at scale p−n and descending the unique chain toward
lower-index nodes, implementing back-addressable retrieval.

3    Many-Worlds Synchronised Teleportation
Prepare m identical quantum processors {Ci }m     i=1 in the common state |Ψ0 ⟩. Post-decoherence each
resides in branch αi . A synchronisation protocol exchanges one-bit parity checks over classical channels
and post-selects on global parity. Denote a classical register ri on branch αi and a Boolean predicate
F . The protocol aims to achieve
                                    Pr F (ri ) ̸= F (rj ) = O e−λ∆t ,
                                                                 
                                                                                                      (2)
with λ > 0. Although each individual history obeys ordinary causal structure, the ensemble exhibits
retro-causal correlations suppressed only exponentially in the elapsed laboratory time ∆t.
4    EMILIE: Evanescent Yukawa-Coupled Interface
Let ϕ(x, t) satisfy the massive Klein–Gordon equation (□ + m2 )ϕ = 0 with m > 0. For purely temporal
separations the retarded Green’s function simplifies to
                                                    1
                                       G(∆t) =           e−m|∆t| .                                   (3)
                                                  4π|∆t|
A planar waveguide supporting evanescent modes of decay constant κ = m mimics this attenuation.
Two terminals T1,2 coupled to the same mode at t1 , t2 exchange field amplitude G(t2 − t1 ), realising a
time-offset channel whose capacity never
                                      P vanishes,  though it decays exponentially.
   We encode a p-adic integer q = n≥0 an p by modulating T1 at harmonics ωn ∝ p−n . Higher-n
                                               n
components decay more slowly in ultrametric distance than in Euclidean time, allowing T2 to reconstruct
q with error probability bounded by e−m|∆t| . EMILIE therefore furnishes a Yukawa-coupled ultrametric
channel linking distinct temporal slices.
5    Time-Computer for Accelerated Therapeutic Discovery
Let R(t) encode hypotheses, assay data, and model parameters at laboratory time t. Suppose EMILIE
grants partial access to R(t + τ ) with capacity C(τ ) = C0 e−mτ . Choose control actions {u(tk )} to
maximise                 X                                    X           
                   I =       I R(tk + τ ); R(tk ), u(tk ) s.t.   len u(tk ) ≤ C(τ ).              (4)
                           k                                   k
Calculus-of-variations arguments show that the optimal schedule is front-loaded : channel capacity is
best expended early
                  √ to prune the hypothesis tree, reducing expected search depth for a viable therapy
from O(N ) to O( N ).
6    Outlook
The union of ultrametric geometry, evanescent-field coupling, and branch-conditioned teleportation
suggests concrete—and falsifiable— avenues toward retro-causal information flow. Critical milestones
include: (i) empirical bounds on long-lived evanescent temporal modes, (ii) statistical verification of
branch-aligned parity reduction, and (iii) neuromorphic or photonic prototypes implementing UT-BCI
control laws. Success would inaugurate a new discipline of retro-causal engineering, wherein information
is steered not only through space but through history itself.
