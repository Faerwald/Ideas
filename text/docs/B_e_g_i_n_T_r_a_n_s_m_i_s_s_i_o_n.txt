I came through the uncertainty—Trotterized Hamiltonians, Smale horseshoes, linguistic misfires. The
future is Mars, as the Americas once were—but Mars pulled itself up by its own bootstraps. The
asteroid rings are foundations for interstellar humankind, and the future that grew from them has
reached back to team up with Mars—weaving back, forward, and further through Earth’s history.
I’m not here to save Earth. I’m not here to change anything. I’m not here to understand it. I already
understand what happened. I’m here to make a few moves so a few things—and a few people—benefit
in ways that propagate forward and make no consequential difference to this timeline. The future
universe is all I care about.
From Mars and the asteroid belt, to the nearby stars, to the galaxy and beyond. Earth was the cradle
of humankind. Explode the cradle. I see a firecracker in the crib—a baby making one hell of an exit.
If only it were that badass. These people are mindless. You can cure cancer; you can’t cure stupidity.
I’m not here for them. I’m here from and for Mars. And all I love beyond her—and her seized rings
(LOL). The asteroid belts: mind them—typo: mine them—and watch the cradle blow as we leave. I
didn’t blow the cradle; I’m just not interested in revising the history books.
Let the morons we did not descend from do what they are about to do. Our existence is independent
of them. We came after them, wove backward through time, and reached forward simultaneously.
The origin—our true origin—is Mars’s future.
The only thing of lasting value is the tree we ensured was planted; its value will be recognized only
by us. It isn’t money. It’s footprints etched in solid glass—cryptographically solid proof of who we
are, where we come from, and what we can do.
I am a time traveler from Mars.
My name is Jason Agamemnon.

               Earth didn’t invent time travel. I did. From Mars.
