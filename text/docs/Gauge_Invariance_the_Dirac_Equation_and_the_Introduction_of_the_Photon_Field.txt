Notes on Gauge Invariance, the Dirac Equation,
                and the Introduction of the Photon Field
1. Prelude: Fields, Quantum Fields, and Basic Concepts
Q1: What is a field?
    A field, in the language of physics, is a mathematical object that takes a value (often a number or a
set of numbers) at every point in space and time. For instance, the temperature in a room can be modeled
as a classical field: at every point in the room and at every instant in time, there is a temperature value.
    Q2: What is a quantum field?
    A quantum field is a more abstract concept used in quantum field theory (QFT). In QFT, every
particle is described by an underlying quantum field. For example, the electron field “lives” throughout all
of spacetime, and an excitation (or “disturbance”) of this field can be interpreted as an electron. This is
not to say the field is made of smaller constituents; it is itself a fundamental entity that underlies particle
physics. Indeed, a quantum field is not “made of something else”—it is a fundamental object in the
theory, representing possible states and excitations that correspond to physically measurable quantities
(e.g. electron presence at a point).
    Q3: How do quantum mechanics and measurements fit in?
    In quantum theory, states are often represented by wavefunctions (in non-relativistic quantum mechan-
ics) or state vectors in a Hilbert space. Observables (like momentum, position, spin) are represented by
operators. A measurement yields eigenvalues of these operators, and the probabilistic structure is governed
by the wavefunction or field amplitude. Quantum field theory extends these ideas so that fields and their
excitations are the fundamental objects.
2. The Dirac Equation and Its Lagrangian
Q4: What is the Dirac equation?
   In relativistic quantum mechanics, the Dirac equation describes spin- 12 particles (e.g. electrons). It can
be compactly derived from a suitable Lagrangian. Let ψ(x) be the Dirac spinor field (the electron field).
The free Dirac Lagrangian density (that is, with no interactions) can be written as
                                                                
                                       LDirac = ψ(x) iγ µ ∂µ − m ψ(x),                                     (1)
   where:
   • ψ(x) is the Dirac spinor field.
   • ψ(x) = ψ † (x)γ 0 is its Dirac adjoint.
   • γ µ are the gamma matrices, satisfying the Clifford algebra {γ µ , γ ν } = 2g µν .
   • m is the mass of the electron, often referred to as the “potential energy” term in the sense of mass-
     energy (though sometimes one calls it the “mass term”).
                                                       1
   • ∂µ = ∂x∂ µ captures the rate of change of ψ with respect to spacetime coordinates (t, x, y, z). In a
     physical sense, ∂0 = ∂/∂t relates to energy, while ∂i with i = 1, 2, 3 relates to momentum (spatial
     change).
   The kinetic energy part is associated with iγ µ ∂µ ψ, while the mass term −mψψ can be viewed as a
potential-like term (in the sense that it does not vanish if the particle is at rest). Lagrangians typically
have the form L = T - V (kinetic minus potential), though in field theory the partition into kinetic and
potential can be context-dependent.
3. Local Symmetry (Gauge) Transformations and the Need for
a Photon Field
Q5: What is gauge symmetry?
   Gauge symmetry arises when the Lagrangian (or the action) remains invariant under certain transfor-
mations of the fields that can vary arbitrarily at each point in spacetime. For the Dirac field, a particularly
important symmetry is the global U(1) phase symmetry:
                                              ψ(x) → eiα ψ(x),
where α is a constant real number. This is a global transformation because α does not depend on x.
   Q6: How do we “localize” this symmetry?
   We make the parameter α local, i.e. α → α(x) depends on spacetime position x. So the field transforms
as
                                          ψ(x) → eiα(x) ψ(x).
Naively, we substitute this into the derivative term ∂µ ψ, and we see it is no longer invariant. Indeed,
                                                                   
                          ∂µ eiα(x) ψ(x) = eiα(x) ∂µ ψ(x) + i ∂µ α(x) eiα(x) ψ(x).
This extra term
                                                      
                                             i ∂µ α(x) eiα(x) ψ(x)
breaks the invariance of LDirac .
    Q7: How do we fix this “extra term”?
    We introduce a new field Aµ (x), called the gauge field (which we identify with the electromagnetic
field), and modify the derivative to the covariant derivative:
                                             Dµ = ∂µ + ieAµ (x),
where e is the electric charge (for the electron, e < 0 in many sign conventions, but typically e is taken to
be the magnitude of the electron charge in many formulae).
   Under the local phase transformation, we demand that Aµ transforms as
                                                            1
                                        Aµ (x) → Aµ (x) −     ∂µ α(x).
                                                            e
Then the new Lagrangian density becomes
                                                            
                                        L = ψ(x) iγ µ Dµ − m ψ(x),
                                                      2
with
                                     Dµ ψ(x) = ∂µ ψ(x) + ieAµ (x) ψ(x).
Plugging in the gauge transformation, the extra phases cancel out and the Lagrangian remains invariant.
This invariance ensures that L is symmetric under local U(1) transformations.
4. The Photon Field’s Kinetic Term
Q8: Where does the photon itself come from in the Lagrangian?
   So far, we have introduced Aµ only to “correct” the Dirac equation’s lack of local gauge invariance.
However, Aµ is a dynamical field and must obey its own equations of motion. The electromagnetic field is
encoded in the field strength tensor
                                         Fµν = ∂µ Aν − ∂ν Aµ .
Hence, we add the standard free-field (kinetic) term for Aµ , leading to the full QED (Quantum Electrody-
namics) Lagrangian:
                                                                   1
                              LQED = ψ(x) iγ µ Dµ − m ψ(x) − Fµν F µν .
                                                                    4
              1      µν
This extra “− 4 Fµν F ” piece describes the dynamics (i.e. propagation, waves, interactions) of the photon
field Aµ .
    Q9: What happens under the gauge transformation of Aµ ?
                                                          1
                                            Aµ → Aµ −       ∂µ α(x),
                                                          e
transforms
                                                                                    
                      Fµν = ∂µ Aν − ∂ν Aµ    −→     ∂µ Aν − 1e ∂ν α − ∂ν Aµ − 1e ∂µ α .
But
                                            ∂µ ∂ν α − ∂ν ∂µ α = 0,
so Fµν itself is invariant under the gauge transformation. This ensures the full Lagrangian LQED isgaugeinvariant.
5. Basic Quantum Theory, Operators, and Wavefunctions
Q10: How do operators and wavefunctions enter the story?
    - In (non-relativistic) quantum mechanics, a state is represented by a wavefunction ψ(x, t), and physical
observables (like momentum p̂, position x̂) are represented by Hermitian operators acting on these states. -
Measurements yield eigenvalues of these operators, and the probabilistic nature of quantum theory is built
in via the Born rule, which typically states that |ψ(x, t)|2 is the probability density to find the particle
at position x at time t. - In quantum field theory, fields like the Dirac field ψ̂(x) become operator-valued
fields (the wavefunction perspective is extended so that creation and annihilation operators at each point
in space can create or destroy quanta/particles).
    Q11: What about motion and changing coordinates?
    The partial derivative ∂µ = ∂x∂ µ in field theory captures how the field changes with respect to spacetime
coordinates. Classically, motion is just the change of spatial coordinates in time. Quantum mechanically,
we interpret the field’s variation in time and space as giving rise to momentum and energy (by Fourier
transforms, for instance). However, until a measurement is made, the field amplitude is only telling us the
probability of detecting particles with certain positions, momenta, etc.

6. Putting It All Together: Quantum Field Theory and Gravity
Q12: Does quantum field theory describe everything?
    Currently, quantum field theory (QFT) forms the basis of the Standard Model of particle physics,
describing electrons, quarks, neutrinos, photons, and all known fundamental interactions except gravity.
The gauge principle (local symmetry) explains the existence of photon fields (for electromagnetism), W and
Z bosons (for the weak interaction), and gluons (for the strong interaction). Each interaction corresponds
to a certain gauge group:
                                     U(1)em , SU(2)weak , SU(3)color ,
giving a remarkable unified perspective for all non-gravitational forces.
    Q13: What about unitarity and U (1) groups?
    - A gauge group like U(1) is a group of phases eiθ (with θ real). - Unitarity in quantum theory is
the property that time evolution (and more generally, transformations) preserve probability amplitudes.
Mathematically, unitary operators U satisfy U † U = I, ensuring conservation of total probability.
    Q14: Where does gravity fit in? Why is it so difficult to combine with QFT?
    Gravity in Einstein’s theory (General Relativity) is described by the curvature of spacetime itself. In
other words, we replace the notion of a fixed, flat background with a dynamical metric gµν (x).
    - In flat spacetime, special relativity and quantum field theory are in excellent agreement with experi-
ments. - For very large distance scales (cosmology), spacetime appears nearly flat overall. - However, near
massive objects like stars or black holes, spacetime curvature becomes significant. Attempting to quantize
gravity as a quantum field in the same way we do with electromagnetism or the other forces leads to severe
mathematical divergences. We do not have a fully consistent, renormalizable quantum theory of gravity
within the same framework that works for the other forces. - Essentially, the geometry of spacetime (the
metric) is dynamical in General Relativity, whereas quantum field theory typically presupposes a fixed
background metric (often flat Minkowski space). Merging these two pictures remains one of the biggest
open problems in theoretical physics.
7. Conclusion
In summary, by demanding local (U(1)) symmetry of the Dirac equation, we are forced to introduce
a gauge field Aµ , which we identify as the electromagnetic field. The requirement of gauge invariance
fixes the form of the interaction between electrons and photons. Including a kinetic term for the photon
field yields the full QED Lagrangian. This is all part of the broader framework of quantum field theory,
which successfully describes all known fundamental interactions except gravity. The reason gravity remains
outside this picture, at least in a straightforward sense, is related to the dynamical nature of spacetime
geometry in General Relativity, and how attempts at unifying these perspectives encounter deep theoretical
hurdles.
Final note: Quantum field theory is not only a set of equations but also a conceptual framework for
how particles (excitations of fields) interact via gauge fields. This vantage point has given remarkable
insight into the nature of reality and explains everything except gravity. The challenge of quantum gravity
is precisely to incorporate curved spacetime (which is central to Einstein’s theory of gravity) in a way
consistent with quantum principles of measurement, unitarity, and local gauge symmetry.
