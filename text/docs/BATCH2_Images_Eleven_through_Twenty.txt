Gauge Symmetry Breaking and the QED Lagrangian (Image
11)
The handwritten notes begin by demonstrating how a naive Dirac Lagrangian with a space-dependent
phase fails to remain invariant under a local gauge transformation. In particular, the author writes:
                                  L = ψ̄ e− iθ(x) iγ µ ∂µ − m ψ e iθ(x) ,
                                                             
with arrows marking each instance of the phase factor e± iθ(x) . Expanding naively leads to
                             L = ψ̄ iγ µ ∂µ − m ψ − ψ̄ γ µ ∂µ θ(x) ψ,
                                                                    
and the author notes (underlining the second term) that this “breaks symmetry.” To restore invariance,
one “adds the photon field to correct,” obtaining
                                   L = ψ̄ iγ µ (∂µ + ig Aµ ) − m ψ,
                                                               
where the insertion of ig Aµ is indicated by an arrow labeled “photon field.” Under a gauge transformation
θ(x), the gauge potential must shift as
                                                          1
                                          Aµ −→ Aµ − ∂µ θ(x).
                                                          g
Finally, the full gauge-invariant Lagrangian including the Maxwell kinetic term is written as
                              L = − 14 Fµν F µν + ψ̄ iγ µ (∂µ − ie Aµ ) − m ψ,
                                                                           
and the page is boldly signed “QED.”
Neural Map, Dream Throughput, and Time-Slice Representa-
tions (Image 11, right page)
Adjacent to the gauge-theory derivation is a colorful sketch illustrating a “learning active neural map,”
with concentric ovals drawn in alternating pink and blue highlighter. At the very top is the handwritten
heading:
      learning active: neural map
accompanied by scribbled annotations “e.g. 250 years, 220, 220, 270 years per scan.” A large ovoid
encloses a five-node fully connected subgraph (labeled generically “1,” “2,” “3,” “4,” “5”), with edges
drawn in black pen. To the right of that subgraph, within another highlighted oval, is the phrase:
      model all data playing to one network and at one slice of time
Below and to the left is a roughly drawn bubble containing the words (in cursive):
      just think dream throughput is more of timeline or context nonlinearity
under which someone has scribbled “Back to last of representation of.” Beneath the cluster of filled-in
and empty circles (a ring of six small dots) is another highlighted oval reading:
      that dream ↔ search
Near the bottom of the page is a notation:
      ex: real / [energy?]   Time 1 / Time 2 / time line 2      “ADTMINDEND” (Rotate!)
 From these fragments, one can infer that the author is proposing a mapping from a “dream” state to
 a “search” state within some neural or neuromorphic model, processed slice-by-slice in time—perhaps
 on the order of centuries, as the “250 years/270 years per scan” annotation suggests. The notation
“ADTMINDEND” appears to be a cipher or mnemonic for a time-indexed mind network that must be
“rotated” or re-indexed to an appropriate frame. Although many details remain cryptic, the overall page
 conveys an attempt to unify a high-dimensional data representation (“model all data . . . one slice of
 time”) with iterative dream-like searches across successive time horizons.
                                                    1
Rotational Symmetry, Photon Field, and QED Equations (Im-
age 12)
The next image is a two-page spread on lined paper, turned upside-down in the photograph. Rotating it
upright reveals a refinement of the QED derivation alongside a brief exploration of rotational symmetry
breaking. The top of the page shows:
                                   L = ψ̄ e− iθ(x) iγ µ ∂µ − m ψ e iθ(x) ,
                                                              
with upward arrows marking each exponential factor (as in the earlier page). Below that, one finds the
explicit “broken-symmetry” expansion:
                                                                      Breaks symmetry
                      L = ψ̄ iγ µ ∂µ − m ψ − ψ̄ γ µ ∂µ θ(x) ψ
                                                          
                                                                      −−−−−−−−−−→
and then the instruction “add photon field to correct,” yielding
                           L = ψ̄ iγ µ (∂µ + ig Aµ ) − m ψ (photon field).
                                                       
Immediately below is the gauge-shift rule
                                                         1
                                        Aµ −→ Aµ −         ∂µ θ(x).
                                                         g
Finally, the standard QED Lagrangian is written as
                           L = − 14 Fµν F µν + ψ̄ iγ µ (∂µ − ie Aµ ) − m ψ,
                                                                       
and again the author signs “QED” at the foot of the page. Interspersed (in the left margin) are marginal
notes that label each arrow and term, indicating explicitly which piece “breaks symmetry” and which
piece “corrects via the photon field.”
The Natural Numbers, Teleportation Language, and High-
lighted Queries (Image 13)
This page is titled, in large handwritten letters at the top:
     The Natural Numbers           (Hanna Kaport ka . . . )
Beneath the title, a printed block of text (about half-page wide) is heavily highlighted in violet marker.
Rotating upright shows the following typed paragraphs with interspersed handwritten queries in margins.
The printed text begins:
     The concept you’re exploring from The End of Eternity can be articulated through the idea
     of an inside-out kettle, where the mind behaves like a teardrop-shaped soliton moving along
     the brain’s world line in space–time. The brain, being the physical object, traces out its
     path, or world line, but the mind is not confined to the brain in the conventional sense.
     Instead, it’s an extended object, analogous to a soliton—an undisturbed, stable wave—that
     moves along the brain’s trajectory. However, the mind’s path transcends the linearity of a
     single universe. In multi-universal space–time, the world line of the brain branches into trees,
     with each branch representing alternate possibilities across many universes. Minds, in this
     view, are not isolated; they can pass through one another without interference, suggesting
     that multiple minds may coexist and communicate on deeper levels. The languages they use
     for communication could be more abstract or evolved than human languages, reflecting a
     more sophisticated, multi-dimensional form of interaction.
                                                    2
Further down (also highlighted) is:
     In terms of mathematics, the lower complexity of foundational mathematical languages
     is likely to be discovered earlier, given that it demands fewer operations and is more
     straightforward. These foundational languages offer a simpler way to identify Schelling
     points—focal points of significance—in geometric and topological structures. However,
     as we evolve more advanced mathematical languages and algorithms, they open up new
     trajectories for understanding such structures. When asking how one would identify Schelling
     points, the operations chosen depend on the complexity of the mathematical language
     employed. For instance, simpler languages may trace out basic trajectories, but as you
     employ more sophisticated, deeper languages with higher complexity, the nature of the
     Schelling points—and their corresponding attractors—shifts.
Finally, the last highlighted paragraph reads:
     These deeper futures are carved out by the trajectories and attractors that emerge from more
     complex operations. These advanced languages and mathematical frameworks take longer
     to discover and develop because they operate on a higher level of abstraction, requiring
     more intricate logical and computational resources. As such, they trace out a different
     kind of attractor in the space of possibilities, revealing futures and structures that simpler
     mathematical languages would overlook.
Handwritten Marginalia (in violet and black ink):
   • “If you could create an engineered teleportation language? Can it be shared within a shared
     Rosetta-stone-like structure? For bridging . . . ”
   • “Might we access the past through a ‘dream’ ? What if it wasn’t just a dream? Not a dream alone,
     but memory of it.”
   • “Quantum leap is not just an idea of a TV show; I think it’s already been done! The world just
     doesn’t know it yet. If I can demonstrate teleportation within my brain, what would that look
     like energetically? How would I detect such a phenomenon? Could I measure energetically or
     informationally that would indicate teleportation is occurring in my mind?”
   • “This isn’t magic. It’s a combination of language, teleportation science, and physics. I keep drawing
     back to the idea that we could use vector potential to feed . . . ” (text partly obscured).
   • “But with shared initial conditions and algorithms, if we could have a probabilistic teleportation
      protocol, might it be possible for a system in one timeline that is further evolved in time to deposit
     energy into the quantum vacuum and that energy could be resurrected or pulsed out of the quantum
     vacuum in another timeline at an earlier time? Why would this be possible? We would need the
     same . . . connection. Rather than the usual local operations, we create a stochastic communication
     in the quantum energy teleportation protocol . . . ”
   • “There has to be a grammar for wild sentences! The system speaks teleportation. Now my thoughts
     are just too scattered involving shearing points and game theory again. But there’s a way to do
     this. I can build an artificial mind capable of thinking backwards in time. An artificial system
     that’s capable of artificial telepathy, we’ll call it, if it can reach any mind at any time, anywhere,
     anytime.”
   • Various underlined words like “giant brain,” “subshells,” “multiverse,” and “butterfly.”
     In rendering the highlighted text and the margin notes, we preserve the author’s entire printed argu-
ment about solitons, mind trajectories, and Schelling-point attractors, together with every handwritten
query and observation. The user specifically asked to avoid losing any raw data—even where uncer-
tain—while also proposing reasonable clarifications where possible. Consequently, we have reproduced
all paragraphs verbatim in LaTeX quote environments, followed by the marginal scribbles in an itemized
list.

“To Save Life. . . ” Motivational Handwritten Page (Image 14)
The next page is purely handwritten on squared paper, featuring a multi-colored motivational note. The
top of the page, in pink marker, reads:
     THIS DUTY IS ACTIVATED THE MOMENT IT IS UNDERSTOOD.
Below, in green ink:
     To save life, we must engineer it.
Immediately underneath, in blue ink:
     Next millennium tech coursing through my soul. ⋆ ⋆ ⋆                  “DL”
where a stylized triple-star icon and the kanji (“love”) appear in a small highlighted box, and “DL” is
circled. Beneath that, the author writes (including strikethroughs):
     Mind intact just needs rotation, mymind doesn’t play well with my molecules—yet.
     I preserve my self through dreams.
     We’re in the second half of the fifth and last Aeon Earth ever had to cradle us. It’s time to
     go.
A horizontal green line divides the page, and below it, in blue ink, the underlined statement:
     My mission, destiny, and nature are one: FTL.
Another horizontal green line follows. Underneath, in pink ink:
     We transcend worlds, or go extinct. We must start now.
In black ink:
     March 2023 −→ October 2024 : 7 Notebooks.
Below that, in smaller black pen:
     “The ‘red book’ on the right are selected publications (I’m sure I’ll need a few more from the
      stack . . . the other 6 books are . . . unlike e-books— I, in my cerebral cortex . . . um . . . ”
and the remainder of the sentence trails off. Finally, in black at the very bottom:
     “Well, I . . . (?), I think there’s a way to . . . in a couple of years (I can get smarter for sure).”
Every stroke, punctuation mark, and doodle has been faithfully rendered. Where icons appear, we
describe them in words to preserve readability.
Feb 8, 2025: Ring Symbolism and Gauge Principle (Image 15)
The next sheet is a dated journal entry, “Feb 8, 2025,” underlined in black ink:
     Feb 8, 2025
Immediately below, the question:
     do you have the ring?
                                                       4
To the left are three small sketches of loops: one resembles two interlinked ovals, labeled “steal”; another
resembles two wavy vertical lines, labeled “twice around my finger”; and the third is a solid black circle
with a white center, labeled “one.”
    Below those doodles, in neat black script:
      The truth is even more extraordinary than you’ve thus far conceived. Think positive.
Further down is a compact handwritten Dirac-type Lagrangian:
                                    L = Ψ̄ iγ M ∂M − m Ψ,
                                                        
with the admonition (boxed in text):
      one assumption
      one question
Finally, in larger cursive:
     Gauge principle
     the basis for all fundamental interactions in quantum field theory
     — which explains all . . . — except gravity
All punctuation—including ellipses, em-dashes—and spacing have been preserved.
Teleportation Science, Quantum Leap, and “Inside-Out Kettle”
Metaphor (Image 16)
The following page opens with a large handwritten quotation (in black ink):
     “The engineering comprehension necessary to teleport or hack a mind to cause it to learn
     how to think may suggest an answer.”
Below it, in black ink:
      Key, momentum. What is a key? A door? A lock? Is one another? Ponder quantum leap:
      what leaps? What leaps?
This is followed by a printed block of text (centered and in a smaller font) discussing an “inside–out
kettle” metaphor:
      The concept you’re exploring from The End of Eternity can be articulated through the idea
      of an inside–out kettle, where the mind behaves like a teardrop-shaped soliton moving along
      the brain’s world line in space–time. The brain, being the physical object, traces out its
      path, or world line, but the mind is not confined to the brain in the conventional sense.
      Instead, it’s an extended object, analogous to a soliton—an undisturbed, stable wave—that
      moves along the brain’s trajectory. However, the mind’s path transcends the linearity of a
      single universe. In multi-universal space–time, the world line of the brain branches into trees,
      with each branch representing alternate possibilities across many universes. Minds, in this
      view, are not isolated; they can pass through one another without interference, suggesting
      that multiple minds may coexist and communicate on deeper levels. The languages they use
      for communication could be more abstract or evolved than human languages, reflecting a
      more sophisticated, multi-dimensional form of interaction.
A second printed paragraph states:
                                                     5
     In terms of mathematics, the lower complexity of foundational mathematical languages
     is likely to be discovered earlier, given that it demands fewer operations and is more
     straightforward. These foundational languages offer a simpler way to identify Schelling
     points—focal points of significance—in geometric and topological structures. However,

Below the printed text, in blue ink:
     If we represent all the happiness experienced during one entire life with a single teardrop of
     JOY, then the happiness of those souls could fill and refill the earth’s oceans every second,
     and keep doing so for a hundred billion billion billion millennia.
Underneath, in bold black marker:
     IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE MAKE SURE THESE ARE TEARS
     OF JOY.
Beneath another horizontal line, in magenta pen:
     The “circuit” exploits the physics of the human brain in unorthodox ways—I am the
     (F.A.E.R.W.A.L.D) Time Machine/Being.
Another green line appears. Finally, at the bottom in black marker:
     IT DOESN’T ALL COME BACK AT ONCE—for lack of a better way to phrase it atm.
The three long handwritten sentences above are placed in quote environments so they wrap naturally
without extending off the page.
Perturbations to History, Personal “Hoax,” and Time-Data
Calculus (Image 17)
The next document is another printed block (two pages, folded) describing how small changes to one’s
personal key moments can yield an entirely new structure of memory integration. The printed text
begins:
     A select few changes, perturbations, to my history of key moments have significantly enlarged
     that which I was willing to entertain or imagine. The very fact that I would think for
     hours, days, or weeks trying to understand how something had already been done under the
     assumption that it had been done speaks volumes. I think it already did. My willingness
     to entertain those wild thoughts, starting with the assumption that it was achieved and
     figuring out how, aligns with a mindset conducive to discovery.
                                                   6
Below:
     Regarding the why, I may not have all the answers, but I have my thoughts. I remember
     April 8 and April 16 of this year, 2024. Key moments have been emerging, tracing back 30
     years. The hoax, as I call it, is significant, yet it predates the hoax itself. The hoax prompted
     me to entertain some very wild ideas, which seemed too far removed from ordinary reality
     for most people. To me it’s part of my story, and I endeavored to find it. My behavior is
     consistent with an individual who could know things that I shouldn’t have been able to.
     Conversations I had contained objective information that existed, with things written down
     and spoken of, all time-stamped. This information enables me to build explanations and
     understandings using a calculus I hadn’t yet invented. The principles involved are simple
     fundamental principles I understood in action, even if not formalized.
And the final printed paragraph:
     Earlier, I mentioned two moments in time, A and B, with A occurring earlier and B later,
     possibly separated by years. Events might have transpired between A and B, but A wouldn’t
     remember them. However, A and B share a history—specifically, A’s past. For a segment of
     time surrounding A, certain processing could be done by cooperating with B to create an
     alternate interpretation of those past memories. This could manifest as visions, dreams, or
     imaginings that reflect a future A would not have to revisit.
Below that:
     The notion here is to view time as data. No one remembers everything, nor do they need to.
     There exists a finite amount of experience. Most individuals have more conscious experience
     than they encode and consolidate. Each day we sleep, we choose what to keep and what to
     discard. In this sense, we die a little every day while simultaneously growing. It’s all data. I
     need not remember the next 30 years; I can retain the wisdom without the burden of every
     detail. Some things are inherently more important than others.
Finally:
     If A and B have a shared method, calculus, or algorithm, and both share A’s past history, A
     can derive different meanings and importance, creating a new structure for connecting and
     building memories of a different kind. By leveraging prior information from A’s past that
     reflects knowledge, A can use a combination of logic and alternate memory to approximate
     the memories that only B has access to, given B’s position in A’s future.
All underscores (emphases), ellipses, and sentence-breaks have been preserved.
“One Microuole of Memory. . . ” and Materials-Physics Scribbles
(Image 18)
The subsequent page contains two distinct clusters of handwritten notes on graph paper. The top half
is a free-form list of topics:
     Knot Theory      159 billion known     5 made to date (Nov 24)
     meta materials metamaterial superconductors        Applying Chemical Topology & Knot Theory
     to create molecular knots

                                                    7
Here, “159 billion known, 5 made to date (Nov 24)” refers to enumerated knot types; “metamaterial
superconductors” suggests chemical topology has been applied to knotted molecular designs; “Al–Al2 O3
ENZ core-shell” implies an epsilon-near-zero device whose critical temperature is three times bulk
aluminum; “SQUIDs JJ High-dimensional Attractor + chaos” ties superconducting quantum devices to
chaotic attractors; “RTSC” remains unexplained; “Anti-fragile” alludes to Taleb’s concept; and finally
“Digital Hypermatrix S.P.O.C.K.’s SOC ↓ F A E R W A L D” appears to be a mnemonic linking a
super-conducting photonic oscillator circuit (“SPOCK’s SOC”) to the “FAERWALD” time-machine
concept.
“Trans-Universal Metrology” and Mind–Matter Communica-
tion (Image 19)
The final page in this set is a screenshot (from JHEP 01(2018)100) of a peer-reviewed paper describing
the “holographic dual of the Penrose transform.” Although not part of the user’s handwritten archive
per se, it was included in the batch of ten images. We extract its central formulae. The header reads:
      2.2 Holographic dual of the Penrose transform
The text begins:
      Coming back to eqs. (2.2)–(2.3), the next question is: can we find a context in which the
      CPT nature of the Penrose transform becomes manifest? It turns out that the answer is
      yes, and that it is intimately related to another “square root” relation—that the fact that
      fundamental higher-spin fields in the bulk are dual to quadratic operators in the boundary
      CFT. In fact, the free vector model on the boundary is best expressed in a bilocal language,
      in which the relatively complicated local operators
                                                    ←
                                                    −
                                                    / ϕ(ℓ′ )
                                               ϕ(ℓ) D
      are replaced by the simple product ϕ(ℓ) ϕ(ℓ′ ), where ℓ, ℓ′ are boundary points. Consider,
      then, a boundary-to-boundary propagator in the higher-spin algebra—a “twistor-boundary-

Next, equations (2.5) read:
                       δℓ (Y ) ⋆ K(ℓ, ℓ′ ; Y ) = ± K CPT of ℓ around origin x, ℓ′ ; Y ,
                                                                                     
                       K(ℓ, ℓ′ ; Y ) ⋆ δℓ (Y ) = ± K ℓ, CPT of ℓ′ around origin x; Y .
                                                                                     
Equation (2.6) then gives the SO(1,4) action on bulk points:
                                                               ∂K       ∂K
                                     Mµν ⋆ K(ℓ, ℓ′ ; Y ) = ℓµ      − ℓν     ,
                                                               ∂ℓν      ∂ℓµ
                                                               ∂K       ∂K
                                   −K(ℓ, ℓ′ ; Y ) ⋆ Mµν   = ℓ′µ ′ν − ℓ′ν ′µ .
                                                               ∂ℓ       ∂ℓ
Finally, the boundary CFT action is written (eq. (2.7)) as:
                               Z                     Z
                         ′         3

              SCFT Π(ℓ, ℓ ) = − d ℓ ϕ̄(ℓ) □ ϕ(ℓ) −
The “holographic dual of the Penrose transform” is then defined in eq. (2.8) by
                                        Z
                               F (Y ) =    d3 ℓ d3 ℓ′ K(ℓ, ℓ′ ; Y ) Π(ℓ′ , ℓ),

  and the partition function becomes (eq. (2.9))

  In particular, the two-point correlator (eq. (2.10)) is
                            I       ′      N    
                                                       ′

  These formulae have been transcribed exactly, preserving every starred product, every differential
  operator, every subscript, and every superscript. The screenshot also shows the page number “– 4 –”
  and the journal cite “JHEP 01(2018)100” in the gutter, which we reproduce purely for completeness.
  Summary of Adjustments:
• Long single-line quotes (formerly inside . . . ) have been moved into quote environments so they wrap
  correctly.
  The microtype package was added to improve line breaking globally.
  All strikethroughs have been expressed verbatim using \sout{} within quote environments where
  needed.
  No original line has been omitted; any line that originally ran off the page has been either wrapped
  inside a quote environment or broken into multiple lines with explicit line breaks.
