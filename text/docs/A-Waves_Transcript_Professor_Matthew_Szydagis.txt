A-Waves
Transcript (Condensed to ~5000 characters, preserving all key information):
Professor Matthew Szydagis wants your permission to use the full Department’s resources to
build your discovery immediately, Jason. The reason: A-waves pass through anything and cannot
be shielded, not even by superconductors, because the Meissner effect only blocks B-fields, not
A-fields. This could be the most powerful form of communication in existence. He wants to start
right away, then publish with you as first author—no stolen credit—but notes that including
professors’ names helps ensure publication.
He insists this discovery is Nobel Prize–worthy. If you need more funding, he’ll provide it. The
entire Department stands behind you. While we must be cautious about extraterrestrial theories,
he wonders if advanced civilizations already use A-waves to communicate, explaining why SETI
detects nothing. Kevin believes it’s destiny and fully agrees with your explanation. The universe
might be “buzzing” with A-waves right now. The Navy and Air Force may already be aware of this
technology. A-waves are unblockable: they can be read inside Faraday cages or
superconductors.
If you succeed in building a “vector potential antenna,” he promises you an honorary PhD. It’s
bigger than graduate school; you’ll be famous overnight, with ample funding to pursue your other
ideas—hyper-resolution brain imaging, hyper-computation, warp drives, propellantless
propulsion. But focus on the antenna first. Prove it works, and you’ll demonstrate you’re a real
inventor. People like Jeff Bezos or Elon Musk could end up calling, offering millions. You’d be hailed
as the next Edison or Tesla.
Once the antenna is done, you can develop sub-millimeter-resolution brain imaging. Current MRI
is low-resolution “bullshit” in comparison; it can’t detect individual neurons firing, but your method
could. The vector potential is real, and your interference concept is brilliant: you could create
remote magnetic fields or artificial monopoles via A-wave interference—once thought impossible.
Professor Szydagis says you could have walked into MIT or Harvard already and gotten a PhD,
but if you finalize this antenna, you deserve not only a doctorate but also a Nobel Prize.
He urges you to avoid any distractions and pursue the vector potential antenna first. The
Department will give you full support and resources. He’s realized you were right all along about
A-waves over the eight years you’ve been coming to him, as well as your ideas on FTL and
wormholes. You may have received poor grades not from lack of understanding but because you
were always “three steps ahead.” This success vindicates all your “crazy” theories. Crucially,
there’s a difference between information transfer and energy transfer: A-waves involve no
energy traveling, which is why they might evade detection or shielding.
About a year or a year and a half ago, you discovered this phenomenon, but you cannot do it
alone. He suggests focusing on your work and, if necessary, remaining single for now to avoid
personal distractions. Channel your past anger and fear into something productive. Build the
A-wave system. He believes in you, and he’s convinced that finishing the vector potential antenna
will bring you money, recognition, and the chance to pursue every dream you have—once you
prove this first invention works.
