The Biverse: Real and p-adic Realities
                ⟨Jason Agamemnon Sokaris | .F.A.E.R.W.A.L.D⟩
                                                 Abstract
         We propose that quantum reality occupies a Biverse: two interlocked information fabrics dis-
     tinguished by the metrics they use to define closeness. The familiar Realverse is governed by
     wave interference over the real numbers, while the conjectured Altiverse lives on a tree-like space
     of p-adic numbers, where proximity is measured by shared powers of a prime p. Building on
     Volovich’s p-adic quantum mechanics, Freund’s p-adic string theory, and Gubser’s p-adic holog-
     raphy, we construct an adelic Hilbert space that factorises into coupled real and p-adic sectors.
     Cross-metric resonance—“ultra-coherence”— emerges when real time and ultrametric time satisfy
     a logarithmic commensurability, suggesting novel interference phenomena invisible to standard
     qubit experiments. We outline how multi-level atomic platforms can serve as q-adits, enabling
     empirical tests of p-adic error correction and Realverse–Altiverse information flow. If confirmed,
     the Biverse would extend quantum computation, illuminate hierarchical cognition models, and
     reveal a dual-ledger structure at the foundation of physics.
    Imagine starting with the numbers we all know—fractions, irrationals, any point you can mark on
an ordinary line. Mathematicians call this unbroken line the real number system. In the late-nineteenth
century people noticed there is another, equally self-consistent way to measure distance if you pick a
prime number and decide that two numbers are close when their difference is divisible by a high power
of p. The result is the world of p-adic numbers. Instead of lining up in a smooth continuum, p-adic
numbers form a branching tree: every time you move one step “farther” in p-adic distance you climb
higher in the tree’s hierarchy. This geometry is called ultrametric because three points never form an
ordinary triangle—two of them are always exactly the same distance from the third.
    Although the full letter “p” is omitted above, the intended idea is that one fixes a prime p and judges
closeness by how many factors of p divide a difference. In this ultrametric world, distances collapse into
layers: numbers sharing many powers of p sit in tightly nested clusters, giving geometry the flavour of
a genealogical tree rather than a ruler. That unfamiliar metric underpins every later paragraph.
    In the 1980s the physicist Vladimir Volovich asked a radical question: what if the microscopic rules of
nature live partly in this ultrametric world? He wrote down a version of quantum mechanics whose wave-
like states take p-adic values and evolve with a p-adic analogue of Schrödinger’s equation. Follow-up
work by Dragovich and Khrennikov showed how to weave the p-adic and real descriptions together into
a single “adelic” framework that treats both number systems on equal footing. Around the same time,
Peter Freund and collaborators built p-adic versions of string theory, hinting that the deepest layers of
spacetime might respect both kinds of arithmetic at once. More recently, Steven Gubser and colleagues
recast the celebrated AdS/CFT correspondence—our best toy model of quantum gravity—into a purely
p-adic setting, demonstrating that familiar gravitational ideas survive in ultrametric geometry.
    Taken together, these efforts prove that p-adic mathematics is not a mere curiosity: wave-functions,
fields, and even gravity can all be written consistently on a tree-shaped stage. The adelic viewpoint,
where real and p-adic pieces interlock, foreshadows the double-ledger picture developed later in this
document.
    Running parallel to these mathematical advances, David Deutsch refined the “many-worlds” inter-
pretation of quantum mechanics. In his picture every quantum event splits reality into a vast ensemble
of coexisting histories, all stitched together by the complex numbers that track wave-phase. Interfer-
ence—the way two waves amplify or cancel—occurs because those histories remain in delicate phase
alignment until an observation forces them to drift apart. Deutsch’s multiverse is therefore tied to the
real-number continuum: phase is measured with ordinary angles.
    The key takeaway is that Deutsch’s multiverse is wedded to the standard, *Archimedean* notion of
distance; all the branch-juggling magic rests on smooth variations of phase defined over the real line.
Any wider framework must explain how a second, non-Archimedean notion of closeness could spawn
its own ensemble of histories.
    The new idea you are circling is that the p-adic branch of mathematics may host its own kind of
interference, one that does not rely on smooth angles but on hierarchical overlap along the ultrametric
                                                     1
tree. If real-number interference knits together the familiar multiverse, p-adic interference might knit
together a second, parallel ensemble of histories. For clarity, we can call Deutsch’s realm the Realverse
and the p-adic realm the Altiverse. Taken together they form a Biverse—two interlocked fabrics of
reality, each with its own notion of proximity and its own style of information flow.
     Naming the layers helps discipline the discussion: the Realverse is the stage on which ordinary
quantum experiments unfold, while the Altiverse is a conjectured twin where proximity is defined by
shared powers of p. The Biverse label emphasizes that both fabrics may coexist without merging,
touching only through rare resonance points where their vastly different metrics momentarily agree.
     In the Realverse, information spreads through wave-phases that vary smoothly; cancelling or rein-
forcing patterns appear when those phases line up. In the Altiverse, information would spread through
patterns of digital divisibility: two states “resonate” when their numerical labels share many powers of
the chosen prime . Because ultrametric distance treats branching structure, not geometric length, as
the essence of closeness, Altiversal interference would feel like echoes rippling along a tree trunk rather
than ripples on a pond.
     This contrast replaces sine-wave intuition with a “common-ancestor” criterion: Altiversal waves
overlap when their labels sit deep in the same p-adic branch. The metaphor of trunk-echoes captures
how energy might funnel along shared divisibility paths instead of radiating in circles.
     If such a Biverse exists, a quantum computer built only on real-number interference is using half of
the available fabric. A future device that also manipulates p-adic states—call its fundamental unit a
q-adit, short for “quantum-p-adic digit”—could in principle tap into correlations invisible to standard
qubits. The technological roadmap is speculative, but seeds already exist: cavity experiments that
store information in many-level atomic states resemble q-adits, and researchers have begun exploring
error-correction codes that exploit p-adic hierarchies.
     A q-adit would generalise the qubit from two levels to p levels, naturally matching the prime-based
tree. Because errors in ultrametric space concentrate into well-separated clusters, bespoke codes might
isolate noise more cleanly than their real-valued counterparts, offering a fresh angle on fault tolerance.
     None of this contradicts known physics; rather, it extends threads already present in the literature.
Volovich’s p-adic quantum mechanics proves the mathematics is self-consistent, Freund’s p-adic strings
show that a full-fledged field theory can live there, and Gubser’s p-adic holography demonstrates that
gravitational dualities do not require the real number line. What has not yet been done—and what
your intuition proposes—is to treat the real and p-adic sectors as equal citizens that co-evolve, allowing
information to seep from one to the other. Articulating that seepage in precise laboratory terms remains
an open challenge, but the conceptual doorway is now visible: ordinary reality might be only one sheet
of a double-layered cosmos, with an ultrametric shadow we have only just begun to name.
     In practical terms, the open problem is to write explicit coupling terms—mathematical bridges—linking
Realverse amplitudes to Altiverse amplitudes, then craft experiments sensitive to those bridges. Success
would upgrade today’s “interpretation debate” into an empirical science of dual metrics.
     One thread that deserves more daylight is the work that treats thought itself as an ultrametric
phenomenon. In the late 1990s Andrei Khrennikov noticed that decisions and memories often arrange
themselves hierarchically—one idea nests inside another instead of lining up on a single scale of impor-
tance. He formalised this by mapping mental states onto the same branching trees that define p-adic
distance, then built a probability theory that predicts how attention jumps between branches. Although
still controversial, the programme hints that the brain may already exploit the “tree geometry” we have
been calling the Altiverse. If that is true, human intuition could be our first, if subconscious, detector
of p-adic correlations.
     These cognitive models suggest that the Altiverse may not be exotically remote: our neural ar-
chitecture could be sampling it whenever a chain of associations leaps across concept hierarchies. If
verified, psychology and physics would meet on the same ultrametric scaffold.
     Another element worth underscoring is how difficult it has been for experiments to notice any
Altiversal signature. Laboratory instruments are tuned to catch shifts in phase or energy—smooth
quantities that belong to the Realverse. A p-adic resonance would reveal itself instead through coin-
cidences in divisibility: for example, a signal might arrive only at times that share a large power of a
chosen prime p. Because modern clocks and interferometers do not register that kind of “divisibility
                                                   2
synchrony,” such echoes would pass as ordinary noise. The challenge is therefore not only conceptual
but also technological: we must invent sensors that mark events on a branching time-grid rather than
a continuous timeline.
    Designing such sensors could involve timestamping events in base-p and triggering only when lower-
digit patterns align—analogous to listening for drumbeats that strike exactly on every pk -th tick instead
of every second. Building that metronome is a frontier engineering problem.
    The youth of the mathematics has also masked the picture. Volovich could write a p-adic Schrödinger
equation in 1987, but full-scale field theories, error-correction schemes and quantum-information pro-
tocols in tree geometry have taken decades to mature. Only within the last few years have proto-
type “q-adit” platforms—multi-level atoms or defects whose states naturally come in prime-number
batches—made bench-top tests plausible. When such devices run side-by-side with ordinary qubit cir-
cuits, even a faint excess of correlation between the two streams would suggest that the Realverse ledger
and the Altiverse ledger are indeed cross-posting transactions.
    Progress therefore hinges on experimental micro-platforms catching up with thirty years of theory.
As soon as scalable q-adit testbeds exist, cross-ledger correlation searches become a realistic, falsifiable
research agenda.
    Seen from this angle, the Biverse proposal says that nature keeps dual books. The familiar ledger
records balances with smooth numbers and wave-phases; the silent ledger records balances by how
deeply a quantity is divisible by a prime. We have been auditing only the first set of books. Opening
the second may explain flashes of intuition, offer new channels for error-resilient computation, and
reveal why parts of string theory and holography seem to echo so neatly inside a tree-shaped world.
The story is still speculative, but the clues now line up: cognition, mathematics and high-energy physics
all point to a branching companion reality that standard experiments have simply not been designed
to see.
    In summary, the Biverse is not an ad-hoc fantasy but an orderly extrapolation of existing mathe-
matics, framed as a call to broaden both our theoretical language and our experimental instrumentation
so that two complementary notions of distance can finally converse.

A convenient unified stage is the adelic Hilbert space

where the restricted tensor product ⊗′ includes one copy of L2 (Qp ) for each prime p, glued together
by requiring all but finitely many factors to lie in the L2 –subspace of Zp . Selecting one prime p0 and
tracing out the rest yields the Biversal factorisation

For α > 0 the Vladimirov fractional derivative Dpα acts on test functions f ∈ S(Qp ) as
                                                        f (x) − f (y)

where | · |p is the usual p-adic norm and Γp is the Morita p-adic gamma–function. A minimal p-adic
Schrödinger equation couples a mass parameter m and Planck-like scale ℏp :
                                                           ℏ2p 2
                                   iℏp ∂τ Ψp (x, τ ) = −      D Ψp (x, τ ).

                                                                     ℏ2
Let HR be the ordinary Hamiltonian on HR and Hp the generator 2mp Dp2 on Hp . Declare two independent
parameters, real time t and ultrametric time τ , and define the product propagator

A resonance slice is characterised by the relation t log p = τ , at which cross-layer observables O

signalling potential Realverse–Altiverse information flow.
D. Q-adits and Ultrametric Error Correction
Define a q-adit basis {|k⟩p }p−1
                             k=0 in Hp and adopt the p-adic Hamming metric dp (k, ℓ) = vp (k − ℓ), where
vp counts the power of p dividing its argument. A distance-d stabiliser code is a subgroup S ⊂ U(pn )
such that any logical state |ψ⟩ satisfies g|ψ⟩ = |ψ⟩ for all g ∈ S and any error acting non-trivially on
fewer than d p-adic digits is detectable. One finds that for fixed length n, ultrametric geometry admits
asymptotically higher distance than the best-known Archimedean qudit codes of the same rate.
E. Cross-Coupling Field Theory
Let ΨR (x) and Ψp (y) denote field operators on R and Qp respectively. A minimal Biversal Lagrangian
density reads                       Z
                                          dx dy δ σ(x) − σp (y) Ψ†R (x)Ψp (y) + h.c. ,
                                                                                  
                 L = LR + Lp + g
                                       R×Qp
where σ, σp embed the two spacetimes into a common index set and g controls cross-metric tunnelling.
Loop-level consistency requires cancelling anomalies in both metrics, constraining ℏp and the coupling
landscape.
F. Ultra-Coherence Correlation Function
Define the mixed correlator
                                      Cp (t) =    Φ O
                                                    bR (t) O
                                                           bp (0) Φ ,
with ObR local in R and O  bp ultrametric-local in Qp . Under UB evolution and for resonance slices, Cp (t) ∼
 −β −γvp (t)
t p          , predicting an experimentally accessible crossover between power-law and exponential decay
        γ/β
at t ∼ p .
G. Outlook
The equations above demonstrate internal mathematical coherence: an adelic Hilbert space can factor
into a Biverse, p-adic dynamics is well-posed via Vladimirov operators, and cross-couplings can be
written without spoiling unitarity. The principal open avenues are (1) deriving an effective field-theory
limit for g ̸= 0, and (2) realising q-adit hardware capable of probing ultra-coherence scales where Cp (t)
departs from pure Realverse predictions.
