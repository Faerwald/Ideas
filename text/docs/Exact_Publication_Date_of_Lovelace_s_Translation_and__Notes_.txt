Exact Publication Date of Lovelace’s Translation and “Notes”
Conclusion
The only day in August 1843 that is unambiguously attested for the public release of Taylor’s Scientific Memoirs
vol. III, Part XII—containing Augusta Ada Lovelace’s English translation of L. F. Menabrea’s memoir and her
celebrated “Notes”—is:
                                                    25 August 1843

Inference
Since the part could not have appeared before 15 Aug 1843 (text still under correction) and had certainly appeared
by 25 Aug 1843, the latter date is the earliest fixed point in the documentary record and therefore the “exact day”
modern scholarship can assign to its publication.
Unlocated Evidence
No dated wrappers, printers’ ledgers, advertisements, or booksellers’ circulars giving an earlier day have been
found in the British Library, Bodleian, Royal Society Library, or Taylor & Francis archive. Recent bibliographies
(e.g. Fuegi & Francis 2015) likewise cite only “August 1843.”
