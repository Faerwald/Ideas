12.1       Maxwell Formalism Revisited
12.1.1     Four–Potential and Lorenz Gauge
Introduce the four-potential Aµ = (Φ/c, A) (metric signature +, −, −, −). In natural units c = ε0 =
µ0 = 1:
                               F µν = ∂ µ Aν − ∂ ν Aµ , ∂µ F µν = J ν .
Choosing the Lorenz gauge ∂µ Aµ = 0 decouples the components:
                                               ∂α ∂ α Aµ = J µ .

mechanics).
