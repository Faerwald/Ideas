                                                   Abstract
          We propose a reactionless thrust mechanism driven by a cognitive actuator (“Oneiro mind”)
      whose influence spans multiple spacetime moments. By imprinting infinitesimal phase biases
      δΦ(x, t′ ) at earlier times and exploiting both chaotic amplification and a temporal-coupling ker-
      nel K(t, t′ ), the system reweights branch probabilities of macroscopic observables at later times
      without expelling reaction mass. The controlled phase field obeys a stochastic diffusion equa-
      tion augmented by topological (Aharonov–Bohm) and temporal coupling terms. Spatial gradients
      ∇Φ convert branch-selected phase configurations into net momentum density p = ℏ∇Φ, pro-
      ducing thrust “off the vacuum.” We detail a bench-scale photonic ring-cavity experiment with
      programmable δΦ modulation to test the concept.
1     Introduction
Quantum-mechanical momentum density is p = ℏ∇Φ, where Φ(x, t) is the phase of the wavefunction.
Conventional drives require reaction mass; here we investigate whether coherent control of Φ alone
can generate net impulse. Building on Aharonov–Bohm phase transport and chaotic sensitivity, we
introduce a distributed cognitive actuator whose “thought” imprints minuscule phase biases across
spacetime. Chaotic amplification and temporal coupling then steer probabilities of macroscopic events,
yielding thrust without expelled mass.
2     Model Framework
2.1    Wavefunction Decomposition
For a subsystem occupying volume V, decompose
                          Ψ(x, t) = R(x, t) eiΦ(x,t) ,   R ≥ 0, Φ ∈ R (mod 2π).                            (1)
Probability density is |Ψ|2 = R2 ; phase Φ encodes local action.
2.2    Cognitive Phase Injection
An external low-energy actuator (“Oneiro mind”) imposes
                                  Φ → Φ + δΦ(x, t),          ∥δΦ∥∞ ≪ 1 rad.                                (2)
These biases originate at past moments t′ and influence future evolution via temporal coupling.
                                                         1
2.3     Topological Coupling
Introduce a configuration-space gauge field Aµ such that closed loops around decoherence defects carry
flux:                                       I
                                               Aµ dxµ ̸= 0.                                        (3)
                                                    Γ
The corresponding topological action T [A, Φ] contributes a term α δT /δΦ.
3       Stochastic Phase Dynamics
3.1     Uncontrolled Evolution
Vacuum fluctuations ϵ(x, t) satisfy
                                 ⟨ϵ(x, t) ϵ(x′ , t′ )⟩ = 2γ δ (3) (x − x′ ) δ(t − t′ ),                          (4)
and the long-wavelength phase obeys
                                             ∂t Φ = D∇2 Φ + ϵ(x, t).                                             (5)
3.2     Controlled Evolution
Extending (5) with cognitive and temporal coupling:
                                                                                t
                                                                δT
                                                                        Z
                     ∂t Φ = D∇2 Φ + ϵ + δΦ(x, t) + α               +β               K(t, t′ ) δΦ(x, t′ ) dt′ .   (6)
                                                                δΦ          0
Here:
    • D is phase-diffusion constant.
    • α scales topological coupling.
    • β scales temporal influence.
                        ′
    • K(t, t′ ) = e−λ(t−t ) Θ(t − t′ ) captures “butterfly” sensitivity.
4       Branch-Weight Functional and Chaotic Amplification
Define branch probability for macro-observable O as
                              hZ                ZZ T                                    i
                                                                  ′
                  P[O] ∝ exp      d4 x Φ δΦ + β      dt dt′ eλ|t−t | δΦ(x, t) δΦ(x, t′ ) .                       (7)
                                                            0
Small overlaps between Φ and δΦ are exponentiated, amplified by chaotic and temporal kernels.
5       Momentum Generation
Local momentum density
                                              p(x, t) = ℏ ∇Φ(x, t).
A sustained gradient ∇Φ = g ̸= 0 over volume V yields
                                           Z
                                    ∆P = ℏ    ∇Φ d3 x = ℏ g V.                                                   (8)
                                                        V
No reaction mass is expelled; net impulse arises purely from phase control.

6    Proposed Experiment
A photonic ring cavity of circumference L = 1 m, containing an electro-optic modulator imposing
δΦ(t) with amplitude ∼ 10−6 rad, can test the effect. A high-Q cavity (Q ∼ 106 ) ensures coherence over
τ ∼ Q/f ≈ 1×10−3 s. The cavity sits on a torsion pendulum with sensitivity 10−12 N. By programming
δΦ(t) according to the feedback law
                                                    Z
                                  δΦn+1 = δΦn + κ (∇Φ − g) d3 x,
                                                          V
we seek a measurable steady force
                                                      ℏgV
                                                F ≈       .
                                                       τ
Parameter estimate:
                  g ∼ 10−3 m−1 ,      V = L A ∼ 1 m3 ,        τ ∼ 10−3 s =⇒ F ∼ 10−31 N,
approaching current torsion limits.
7    Discussion and Outlook
The concept blends quantum phase control, chaotic sensitivity, and temporally distributed cognition.
Key challenges include decoherence, precise phase bias generation, and isolating tiny forces. Extensions
may consider nonlinear media to amplify phase gradients or superconducting circuits for reduced noise.
8    Conclusion
Oneiro–Phase Propulsion posits that a distributed cognitive actuator can generate reactionless thrust
by steering quantum-phase branch probabilities across time. Experimental tests with high-Q photonic
cavities and torsion detection could validate or falsify this speculative framework.
