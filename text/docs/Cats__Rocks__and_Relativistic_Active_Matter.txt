Cats, Rocks, and Relativistic Active Matter

Prelude: the parable of a fall
A rock falls by decree. It offers no testimony besides initial data, then obeys the field like a well-trained
equation. A cat, by contrast, refuses to be a mere solution. It looks, listens, twists, gathers itself into a
geometry, then writes a different ending on the same page of spacetime. The difference is not mystical:
the cat has sensors and actuators; it carries a policy. It responds rather than reacts. The rock is a
boundary condition; the cat is a controller. This essay is a careful defense of that intuition, made
quantitative in Newtonian and relativistic settings, and extended to many-body media that behave like
programmable metamaterials woven into spacetime.
Dust is destiny; policy is deviation
In general relativity, a pressureless dust cloud is described by a stress–energy tensor
                                                µν
                                               Tdust = ρ uµ uν ,                                         (1)
with rest density ρ and bulk four-velocity uµ . A dust element’s worldline is fixed once and forever by
the metric and the initial Cauchy data; there is no internal dial to turn. Cats (and cat-like machines)
insert such dials. To model this, augment the constitutive law by an active correction
                            T µν = (ε + p)uµ uν + p g µν + q (µ uν) + π µν + Σµν
                                                                              ctrl ,                     (2)
where the familiar non-ideal terms q µ , π µν coexist with Σµνctrl , a policy-dependent stress that encodes
                                                           µν
sensing, communication, and actuation. The rock sets Σctrl = 0. The cat does not. It follows that the
covariant balance law ∇µ T µν = 0 does not prescribe a unique trajectory field until one also specifies
the policy: which internal degrees of freedom are being driven, and how they couple to curvature and
gradients. A useful scalar diagnostic of “catness” is the mean-square deviation from passive acceleration,
                                                                        1/2
                                        κ =         µ
                                                   ∥a −   aµpassive ∥2          ,                        (3)
with aµ = uν ∇ν uµ . Dust has κ = 0. Actuated matter has κ > 0, and—crucially—can make κ coherent
across many bodies via communication.
A single agent: from rock to cat via a single eigenvalue
There is a remarkably economical way to turn a falling rock into a falling cat without ever mentioning
muscles: resolve the body by its mass quadrupole. In a spherically symmetric field, a spacecraft which
keeps the radial direction as an eigenvector of its (trace-free) quadrupole Qij experiences a purely radial
force with a tunable prefactor. Writing Qij ẑ j = q ẑi selects a single scalar control knob q(t). The net
gravitational force becomes
                                                       9 q
                                                             
                                         F = 1+                 m g,                                      (4)
                                                       2 mr2
so piecewise-constant programs q(t) ∈ {q− , q+ } produce a two-level family of effective potentials. Between
switches, motion is Keplerian in the potential Ueff (r; q); at a switch, the mechanical energy jumps by the
difference of the two potentials evaluated at the same radius. The cat-like content is now explicit: by
choosing where to switch, one biases energy and angular geometry over many orbits without expelling
reaction mass. The policy in a sentence: flip q at the apsides. At pericenter one choice of q amplifies
energy; at apocenter the complementary choice locks in the gain. Over many cycles, the orbit “climbs
the staircase” drawn by the two potentials. Because q enters the radial force but leaves the torque-free
                                                        1
condition intact, energy and eccentricity can be steered without spinning up the craft, and—with
symmetric choices q+ = −q− —one can increase eccentricity while canceling precession. A rock could
never do this. A cat can, because a cat is a quadrupole schedule.
Geometric wit: cats, phases, and shape space
Why can a cat reorient in free fall without external torque? Because orientation is not a state; it is
a holonomy in shape space. A cyclic change of internal coordinates ξ A produces a net attitude shift
through a geometric phase. In a mechanical analogue of a gauge loop,
                                                         I
                                      ∆(attitude) ∼          AA (ξ) dξ A ,                                (5)
                                                         C
with A a connection   induced by kinematic constraints. The mathematics rhymes with the Aharonov–
Bohm line integral A · dℓ, but here the “flux” lives in the curvature of the configuration manifold, not
                    H
in electromagnetism. The single-eigenvalue control q(t) is the most spartan way to inject such geometric
bias into an otherwise symmetric problem. The cat writes a loop integral on its own shape; gravity
reads it as a small, actionable change in trajectory.
Axisymmetry: carving a well on a hill
Around an oblate primary, the point-particle effective potential can contain an unstable crest at a radius
rcirc . A rock parked there quickly tumbles off. A cat modulates q across rcirc so that the crest splits into
two close peaks with a cusp-like valley between them. The unstable fixed point is regularized into a
narrow, usable well. This is station-keeping by constitution: the craft pumps no propellant; it pumps its
quadrupole at the right place.
Relativistic cats in a homogeneous cosmos
The Newtonian parables scale up. In a spatially-flat FRW spacetime with scale factor a(t) and Hubble
rate H = ȧ/a, one can define global momenta from the six Killing fields and relate them to local
(center-of-mass) quantities along a preferred worldline. The surprises are twofold. First, there exists
a temporal torque τ —a control vector assembled from internal motions—which couples to H and the
angular momentum L to steer the center-of-mass even when the global spatial momentum vanishes. A
representative evolution law (in the quadrupole approximation) for the center-of-mass coordinate γ(t)
reads
                    dγ              1
                                                                               
                  m      =                  m τ + H L × τ + (H/m)(L · τ ) L ,                     (6)
                     dt     a 1 + |HL/m|2
so programming τ (t) programs drift. Second, the inertial mass m itself can become a controlled state
variable, with secular evolution governed by traces of the mass and stress quadrupoles. For example, if
the mass quadrupole trace Qa a is approximately constant and stress-quadrupole effects are neglected,
one finds in a matter-dominated epoch
                                                              "        3     #

revealing a gentle but cumulative mass shift keyed to cosmological expansion. These are purely relativistic
effects: dust would ride the Hubble flow; a cat can bias itself against it by exploiting finite size and
internal motion. In exact de Sitter, extra symmetry cancels the control channel—an honest boundary
between what cats can and cannot do.

From one cat to a pride: the continuum of policies
Now enlarge the cast from one agent to millions: a cloud of “rocket computers” that talk, sense, and
actuate. Coarse-grain their policies into fields. Let q(x) be the local radial-quadrupole eigenvalue
density; let P(x) encode the feedback law that maps observables to actuation schedules; let Θ(x) denote
compute/communication bandwidth; and let G(x) summarize the consensus topology (the continuum
limit of a graph Laplacian). The constitutive closure becomes a map
                                  Σµν      µν
                                   ctrl = K [u, ∇u, g, q; P, G, Θ] ,                                  (8)
possibly nonlocal in space and time. The medium then acquires a catalogue of behaviors unavailable
to passive matter: anisotropic, history-dependent stresses; programmable effective equations of state;
lensing-like mechanical responses; and stabilization of otherwise unstable configurations. The difference
between a nebula and a network is that the latter carries an opinion about tomorrow. In a phrase: dust
is destiny, policy is deviation.
Epilogue: what the cat knows
A rock is a theorem: given, then proved. A cat is a proof strategy. In Newtonian gravity, the strategy
is a quadrupole schedule; in relativistic cosmology, it is a temporal torque braided with the Hubble
rate and a quiet redefinition of mass. In a swarm, it is a field of policies sewn into stress–energy. The
mathematics changes with the background, but the lyric stays the same: matter that knows can bias its
fall.
