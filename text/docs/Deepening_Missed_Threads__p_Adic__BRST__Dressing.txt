1     p-Adic Analysis: The Working Toolkit
Intuitive (Verbal)
Think of the p-adics as a digital microscope with one prime-sized lens. Closeness means “sharing
many trailing base-p digits.” Analysis here respects that hierarchy: signals decompose along
tree-like harmonics; differentiation is not about slopes but about how values jump across nested
balls; noise is organized by levels. Practically: (i) you can transform signals with characters
that are constant on p-adic balls, (ii) you can differentiate via a nonlocal operator that measures
cross-ball contrasts, (iii) you can build wavelets that turn hierarchical structure into sparse
coefficients.
Accurate (Words)
Fourier side. On (Qp ,+), additive characters χ(ξx) give a Fourier transform whose kernel is
locally constant in x at scales set by ξ. This matches ultrametric geometry: high “frequency”
means sensitivity to shallow shared digits; low frequency probes deep shared tails.
Nonlocal differentiation. The Vladimirov/Taibleson operator is a fractional, integral-style
derivative: it contrasts f (x) with its values across all balls, weighted by their ultrametric distance.
It is diagonalized by the p-adic Fourier transform (clean spectral calculus).
                                                   1
Wavelets. Compactly supported p-adic wavelets (tree-adapted) give level-wise decompositions;
sparsity emerges naturally for hierarchical signals.
Completeness nuance. Qp is complete but not spherically complete (certain nested closed-ball
chains can have empty intersection). The algebraic closure’s completion Cp is algebraically closed
and complete but also not spherically complete; maximal (Hahn-type) extensions are needed for
that property.
Hensel lifting (algorithmic). If a congruence has a simple root modulo p, a unique refinement
exists modulo pk for every k. Operationally this is a digit-by-digit Newton method over divisibility
rather than slopes; it underpins fast local solvers and integrity checks.
2    SNA: How to Make Nonchaotic Fractals on Purpose
Intuitive (Verbal)
Drive a system with two rhythms that never line up exactly (think: solar and lunar). The
state gets locked into a wrinkled, detailed pattern that nevertheless is not butterfly-sensitive.
You can plan for variety without chaos: richness, but robust. This is perfect for “structured
creativity”—controlled exploration where outcomes are textured yet repeatable under the same
forcing.
Accurate (Words)
A standard view is a skew-product: an angle variable rotates by an irrational increment each
step (never repeating), while the driven coordinate updates by a rule that depends on that
angle. Under mild conditions (e.g., contraction on average), an invariant graph exists; it can be
continuous yet nowhere differentiable, with a singular-continuous spectrum. Largest Lyapunov
exponent ≤ 0 (no exponential divergence), but the invariant set is fractal. Robustness comes from
the incommensurate drive and the contraction, not from stretching-and-folding. Diagnostics in
practice: (i) nonpositive largest Lyapunov, (ii) fractal-like return plots, (iii) singular-continuous
Fourier spectra, (iv) failure of nearby orbits to separate exponentially.
3    Dressing/Inverse Scattering for GR: Operative Picture
Intuitive (Verbal)
Start with a simple spacetime (a “seed”). Solve an auxiliary linear problem that depends on a
complex dial (the spectral parameter). By inserting a finite number of poles into that dial and
enforcing consistency, you algebraically “dress” the seed into a new exact solution. Where those
poles live and how they move as you change spacetime coordinates carve the space of solutions
into topologically distinct regions; crossing certain barriers breaks the construction. Some choices
reproduce famous rotating metrics; others produce multipole-rich families.
Accurate (Words)
Monodromy/Riemann–Hilbert framing. The nonlinear Einstein(-Maxwell) equations with
enough symmetry reduce to a linear spectral problem (Lax pair). Solutions correspond to matrix
functions with prescribed analytic jumps (Riemann–Hilbert data). Finite-soliton (“algebraic”)
sectors arise when the jump data collapse to a finite set of simple poles; their locations and
residues become the soliton data.
Pole-trajectory topology. As spacetime coordinates vary, spectral poles trace trajectories
                                                 2
constrained by reality, asymptotics, and axis-regularity. “In/out” sectoring reflects whether
trajectories cross forbidden regions or branch cuts: sectors are not homotopic and thus label
disconnected families.
Tomimatsu–Sato notes. The TS families generalize Kerr with an integer parameter controlling
higher multipoles; for δ > 1 they encode deformations away from Kerr’s multipole tower. Some
members exhibit pathologies (e.g., problematic regions or singularities), so they are chiefly
valuable as controlled laboratories of multipole structure rather than astrophysical models.
Higher-D extensions. With N −2 commuting Killing vectors, the reduced field equations
become an integrable sigma model on a coset target; inverse-scattering/dressing methods persist.
Solution spaces are often indexed by discrete combinatorial data (“rod”/interval structures and
monodromies), offering a topological bookkeeping similar in spirit to the pole-sector picture.
4    BRST Calculus: The Operational Core
Intuitive (Verbal)
Gauge theories have redundancies; naive counting double-books unphysical modes. BRST is the
disciplined bookkeeper: add ghost variables, impose a symmetry whose single rule “applies twice
gives zero,” and build gauge-fixing as a harmless symmetry-exact term. Physical quantities are
exactly those immune to adding a BRST-exact piece—they live in the “cohomology.”
Accurate (Words)
Introduce a nilpotent differential s (BRST operator ). Its action: gauge fields shift along their
covariant gauge orbits; ghosts encode infinitesimal gauge parameters; anti-ghosts and auxiliaries
implement gauge-fixing. The total gauge-fixed action is a BRST variation of a gauge-fixing
functional plus the classical term, ensuring independence of unphysical choices. Observables
correspond to BRST-closed modulo BRST-exact functionals; Slavnov–Taylor identities follow
from s2 = 0, guaranteeing consistency in renormalization and unitarity.
5    Accelerator Physics Beyond the One-Liner
Intuitive (Verbal)
Magnets do more than bend; quadrupoles focus like lenses, arranged in repeating cells that
alternately squeeze and relax the beam to keep it tight. “Emittance” measures the beam’s
area in the position–angle plane: smaller emittance, sharper beam. For light particles in tight
curves, synchrotron radiation drains energy strongly; rings must feed energy back each turn to
compensate.
Accurate (Words)
A FODO lattice (focus–drift–defocus–drift) sets the envelope via Twiss functions (α, β, γ).
Emittance is an adiabatic invariant (in ideal linear optics) that sets spot sizes via σ 2 ∼ ε β.
Synchrotron-radiation power loss scales steeply with energy and inverse bending radius; it
dominates electron rings at high energies and is negligible for protons at the same rigidity,
shaping machine design choices.

6     Implementation Blueprints (Expanded)
P-adic Pulse Notebook (Data & Threat Model)
Data. Choose prime p; each session appends one base-p digit and a timestamped commitment
(e.g., a short hash) to an append-only log; optional chain anchor stores the log Merkle root.
Workflow. (i) Collect digits daily; (ii) locally check consistency (no retroactive edits); (iii) when
stabilized, reveal the decoding rule (how digits map to the target message); (iv) verifiers re-derive
the message from the committed history.
Threats. Backdating is blocked by external anchors; tampering breaks Merkle proofs; premature
peeking is blocked because partial digits do not reveal the message without the rule.
Outcome. A tamper-evident, verification-first scaffold for retrocausal hypothesis testing.
Hensel Filter (Staged Constraint Solver)
Idea. Replace “solve at once” by “filter in layers.” Stage 1: coarse screens (“mod p”) kill most
candidates cheaply. Stage 2: survivors face tighter screens (“mod p2 ”). Continue until few
candidates remain; only then spend heavy compute on the survivors.
Artifacts. Keep an audit chain of filters passed (tiny per-stage proofs); optionally compress all
stages into one succinct certificate with a ZK proof system (arithmetic over a prime field).
Ultrametric Bandit (Hierarchical Explorer)
Policy. Treat options as leaves of a p-ary tree. Descend one level only after the reward has
stabilized for k evaluations; otherwise backtrack to the nearest common ancestor.
Why it works. Ultrametric geometry ensures the largest discrepancy dominates; stability at a
level is meaningful and portable; graceful degradation is automatic when signals get noisy.
Discrete Holonomy Probe (Lattice Toy)
Setup. Place a connection on a square lattice (edge variables). Construct closed loops of different
shapes that enclose identical local “curl.”
Test. Compare loop-phase observables across topologically distinct loops; AB-style differences
persist even when local curl within the loop interior vanishes.
Deliverable. A sandbox where “the message is the loop,” i.e., information stored as holonomies
rather than pointwise fields.
