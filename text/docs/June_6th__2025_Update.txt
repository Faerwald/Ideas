June 6th, 2025 Update
1. Core Premise – “I can control my mind; I can count on physics.”
     • Decision—making and disciplined cognition are fully under my jurisdiction.
     • Natural law is dependable; people are not. Everything else is noise.
2. Immediate Objectives
   2.1. Professor Software – Finish the deliverable that secures my arrangement.
   2.2. Three–Hour Idea Session – Ten ideas × 18 min each ⇒ 180 min total. Craft
        ten tightly scoped mini–lectures and rehearse until each is self–contained and
        crystal–clear.
   2.3. Optionality – Matthew is a conduit, not a gatekeeper; alternative mentors re-
        main on the table.
3. Tactical Reading Plan
     • Primary: Robert Greene, The Laws of Human Nature—a field manual for pat-
       tern–recognising motives and avoiding exploitation.
     • Secondary: The 48 Laws of Power if further strategic framing is required. Machi-
       avelli is background texture, not primary source.
4. Interpersonal Protocols
     • Professional – Zero dependence on any single collaborator; diversify academic
       relationships.
     • Romantic –
         – No tolerance for disrespect.
         – Casual sex is disqualifying; willingness to envision centuries–long partnership
           is baseline.
         – Rapid escalation → disengage.
         – Filtering rigorously accepts high attrition; desire sets the threshold.
5. Cognitive Reframing
     • Retire the Ada Lovelace fixation and all “ghost” narratives; recognise them as
       prescience plus pain, not external affection.
     • Treat the “dream scar” as evidence of anomalous information timing—e.g. accu-
       rately expressing details from Prelude to Foundation, The End of Eternity, and
       Ada Lovelace biographies on key dates before I physically obtained or read those
       books—attributable to my own mind or unknown physics, not a love story.
     • Conclusion: the phenomenon is real, but its source is internal capability, not
       romantic destiny.
