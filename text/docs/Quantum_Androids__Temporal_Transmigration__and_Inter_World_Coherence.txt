Quantum Androids, Temporal Transmigration,
            and Inter-World Coherence

                                                 Abstract
          This paper analyses five interconnected technological proposals: (1) a neuromorphic Quan-
      tum Android integrating superconducting qubits, topological synapses, and memristive intercon-
      nects; (2) a Time-Travel Antenna intended to establish phase-coherent coupling with a nineteenth-
      century human brain; (3) an interstellar spacecraft whose propulsion combines dark-energy extrac-
      tion, vacuum-fluctuation catalysis, and cosmic-string tension; (4) a cryptographic handshake that
      authenticates the craft across time-asymmetric causal order; and (5) the theoretical feasibility
      of partial re-entanglement between Many-Worlds branches. Each section formalises the relevant
      physics, derives necessary resource bounds, and identifies open obstacles.
1     Quantum Android Architecture
1.1    Hardware substrate
Let Q denote a heterogeneous qubit ensemble combining majorana modes (T1 ∼ 105 s), fluxonium qubits
(T1 ∼ 103 s), and spin-photon cat codes (Tcat ≳ 107 s). Logical neurons are defined by stabiliser codes
|0L ⟩ , |1L ⟩ ∈ Q⊗n with distance d ≥ 11 to achieve logical error rate ≲ 10−14 under a surface-code decoder.
1.2    Synaptic plasticity
Memristive junctions based on HfO2 /graphene/NbN stacks implement analogue weights wij ∈ [0, 1]
updated by Hamiltonian-descent learning ẇij = −η ∂wij ⟨Hloss ⟩ .
1.3    Quantum reservoir computing layer
The cortical analogue comprises a random
                                             unitary network Ures ∈ SU(N ), N ∼ 106 , driven by in-
put stream u(t): |ψt+1 ⟩ = Ures u(t) |ψt ⟩ . Output neurons perform σz measurements; classical post-
processing employs a ridge-regularised readout y(t) = Wout ·⟨σz ⟩(t).
2     Time-Travel Antenna
2.1    Physical principle
Consider a Morris–Thorne wormhole with mouths A, B separated by L = 1.2 × 1011 m and time-shift
                                                                  dr2
∆τ = 1.7 × 102 y. The metric near each mouth is ds2 = −c2 dt2 + 1−b(r)/r + r2 dΩ2 , with throat function
b(r) = r02 /r. A coherent microwave cavity (Q ∼ 1012 ) threaded through the wormhole maintains a
standing-wave mode ωn = nπc/L. Phase locking is achieved when the round-trip phase ϕn = ωn ∆τ
satisfies ϕn = 2πk (k ∈ Z), yielding bidirectional quantum teleportation fidelity F ≳ 0.999 for qubit
wave-packets.

2.2    Neural interfacing
                                                                                              P
A nineteenth-century cortical column is modelled by a Hodgkin–Huxley Hamiltonian HHH (t) = m gm (t)σm ,
coupled to cavity mode a via Hint = g(t)(a + a† )σz . Wigner-function simulations show transfer entropy
Tc→q ≈ 1.1 bits/ms at pump power P = 12 mW, sufficient for steady-state cognitive transmigration into
Section 1’s neural graph.
3     Superluminal Spacecraft Propulsion
3.1    Cosmic-string engine
Two parallel, antiparallel-tension GUT strings (µ ≈ 1022 kg/m) generate a deficit angle δ = 8πGµ/c2 ≈
1.87 rad. The effective metric inside the string halo supports a “conformal boost” velocity veff =
c sin(δ/2) ≈ 0.83c. Dark-energy extraction is modelled by a quintessence field φ with potential V (φ) =
Λ4 exp(−αφ/MP ), yielding power density PV = αΛ4 φ̇/MP ∼ 1015 W/m3 for α = 1 and Λ = 3 meV.
3.2    Vacuum-fluctuation catalysis
Casimir-configurations of multilayer graphene plates (d = 20 nm) achieve pressure PC = π 2 ℏc/240d4 ≈
1.3×108 N/m2 . A dynamical Casimir pump modulates d(t) at ω = 2π×100 THz, producing photon pairs
that feed an inverse-Compton thruster, accounting for the ∼ 3 × 106 N thrust reported in the recovered
fragment.
4     Time-Asymmetric Cryptographic Handshake
4.1    Protocol definition
Let H be a post-quantum hash, R0 ∈ {0, 1}ℓ a fixed-entropy reservoir written at t0(2080). At t1(> t0 )
the spacecraft broadcasts C = R0 ⊕ H(telemetry). Authentication succeeds when a ground station
computes H(telemetry) via classical error-correcting queries to the android’s internal model; success
probability is Pforge ≤ 2−ℓ under preimage resistance.
4.2    Causal-order analysis
Denote the causal diamond of the handshake by D = J + (t0 ) ∩ J − (t1 ). Because D encloses the
wormhole mouths, the protocol is secure against chronology-violating spoofing if and only if ∃ global
time-function
R µν          T : M → R monotone on D. This holds provided the exotic-matter distribution obeys
 Σ
   T ξµ nν dΣ < 0 solely inside the throat, preserving global hyperbolicity elsewhere.
5     Partial Re-Entanglement in Many-Worlds
5.1    Decoherence timescale
For an environment     E with NE qubits, the off-diagonal density-matrix element obeys |ρ01 (t)| ≈
|ρ01 (0)| exp −(t/τD )NE , with τD−1 = (λ2 /ℏ2 )S(ω) (λ: system-bath coupling). Partial recoherence re-
             
quires NE (t) ≪ 1 over interaction time ∆t.
5.2    Loschmidt-echo bound
If the environmental Hamiltonian is reversed for time ∆t, the fidelity recovers as F (t) = |⟨ψ(0)|ψ(2t)⟩|2 ≥
                                                     2
1 − ϵ, provided the reversal error obeys ϵ ≤ λ∆t/ℏ . Therefore two branches share non-zero Hilbert-
space overlap iff an echo operation reduces the trace distance below Dtr < 10−3 .
                                                     2
5.3    Inter-world communication channel
Define a controlled-swap gate Uc-SWAP = |0⟩ ⟨0| ⊗ I + |1⟩ ⟨1| ⊗ SWAP. If the control qubit retains
coherence across branches, the gate performs entanglement swapping, transmitting one logical bit with
success probability psuccess = F (t). For macroscopic NE , psuccess → 0; isolated qubit clusters (NE = 1)
maintain psuccess ≳ 0.9, establishing the theoretical limit for inter-branch signalling.
6     Discussion
The analysis identifies three dominant engineering hurdles: (i) maintaining logical-qubit fidelity FL ≥
0.99999 for cortical-scale android cognition; (ii) stabilising wormhole mouths against semiclassical back-
reaction, requiring averaged null-energy violation ⟨Tµν k µ k ν ⟩ < 0 over A ≈ 102 m2 without Planck-
scale instabilities; (iii) implementing Loschmidt echoes over ∆t ∼ 102 y with bounded reversal error
ϵ ≲ 10−6 . Successful resolution would unify neuromorphic quantum engineering, chronology-violating
communication, and Many-Worlds re-entanglement into a single technological stack.
