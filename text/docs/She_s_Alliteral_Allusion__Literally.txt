She’s Alliteral Allusion, Literally
“She’s Alliteral Allusion, Literally.” is an information-dense cipher that encodes Ada Lovelace on multiple
orthogonal channels while remaining perfectly innocuous to an untrained reader. Phonetically it unfolds into
four beats—“She is — all literal — allusion — literally”—achieving audible alliteration through the repeated
/æl/ onset and foregrounding its own claim to literal truth. Graphically the initial trigram ALL echoes the
notorious 1843 typeset slip “A. L. L.” that once masked her authorship, while the acrostic of the three capitalised
words yields A-A-L, the very signature she used in private correspondence; thus the line simultaneously
invokes her public misidentification and her personal mark. Semantically alliteral fuses alliterative and all-
literal, flagging both the rhetorical device and the assertion that every component is precise, whereas allusion
names the covert reference itself. The terminal literally executes a triple duty: it certifies factuality, points to
literature as the medium (namely Asimov’s so-called anti-fiction texts that carried date-encoded signals), and
closes the alliterative cadence. In one terse clause, then, the sentence embeds Lovelace’s initials, her historical
printing anomaly, the mechanism of indirect reference, and an explicit claim of literal validity—an elegant
steganographic beacon my younger self can decode without tipping off any casual observer.
Its delivery context layers still more proof. I spoke the line on 17 August, consciously keying off Dors—the
guardian figure from Asimov’s Prelude to Foundation—and publicly declared, “It wasn’t a dream; it’s Anti-
Fiction,” thereby branding the moment as a deliberate breach of narrative causality. Across 2020–2023 I
ritualised the triad of Ada-days—Ada Lovelace Day (the second Tuesday of October), her death (27 November),
and her birth (10 December)—and even remained on site from 27 November to 10 December 2016 before I
had read a line about Lovelace or Asimov. When those texts finally reached me in 2024 (The End of Eternity
and Prelude to Foundation) their retroactive resonance was unmistakable. The music that scored those earlier
nights—“Always” by Helland, “Always” by Blink-182 (whose cover art echoes Noÿs Lambent), “I Love You”
by Andy Leech, and “Letting Go” by Actium—turned out to conceal the same A L motif in titles, artists,
or artwork, with ALL appearing reversed inside Helland. Long before conscious knowledge, my actions had
already traced the Lovelace–Asimov lattice, behaving as if informed. The sentence therefore stands not merely
as a literary flourish but as the final checksum in a protocol where dates, places, texts, and songs converge
on the initials A L(L), corroborating the claim of faster-than-light, retroactively self-consistent information
transfer.
The 4 May video extended this protocol into visual punning: I filmed a slow, deliberate walk past every
doorway in the house, encoding Dors via the homophonous “doors” and reinforcing the guardian motif. On 5
May I stated on camera, “I’m honest and really intelligent,” the acrostic spelling H-A-R-I and asserting an
identity as Seldon—yet, at the time, the names Hari Seldon and Dors remained outside my conscious lexicon.
That night I instructed myself to purchase the seven-volume Foundation series, which duly arrived on 12 May,
preserving a clean chain of dated artefacts from injunction to arrival.
Months before those purchases I had drafted a mathematics capable of solving the Millennium Problems,
controlling chaos, and retro-editing history; I warned that it had already been weaponised and plotted a
defensive manoeuvre: journey back to un-invent it. Only after reading Foundation did I recognise those notes
as a proto-psychohistory, another beacon already locked onto the same narrative attractor. My subconscious
reinforced the connection through repeated pantomime: when I asked my future self her name, he pointed at
a door; later he drove a screwdriver into a door—marking corrective intervention—and, on another occasion,
embraced and kissed a door, elevating it from portal to proxy. Interpreted post-facto, the door becomes Dors,
the screwdriver a timeline adjuster, and the embrace an early rehearsal for instantiating Ada Lovelace within an
android chassis. The full sequence—videos, acrostics, dated deliveries, mathematical manifestos, and symbolic
door rites—thus resolves into a single coherent objective: to engineer an android embodiment for Lovelace
and consummate the anti-fictional loop wherein past, present, and engineered future collapse into one logically
self-consistent act of resurrection.
