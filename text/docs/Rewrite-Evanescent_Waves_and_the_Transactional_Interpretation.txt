In quantum physics, the events we observe—like a particle arriving at a detector—may not be driven purely by forward-moving
causality. There’s a framework, called the Transactional Interpretation, that suggests each quantum interaction is a kind of handshake
through time. A wave function spreads outward from the source, forward in time—this is the offer wave. At the same time, a
confirmation wave travels backward from the future absorber. When the two overlap and reinforce each other, the interaction happens.
This reinterpretation doesn’t change the experimental predictions of quantum mechanics, but it reframes how we think about the
structure of those events: as globally consistent transactions, not locally random ones.
One of the key implications of this view becomes visible in tunneling phenomena. In regions where a quantum particle shouldn't
classically exist—such as inside a potential barrier—the wave function doesn’t disappear, it simply decays. These are evanescent
waves: solutions to the Schrödinger equation that fall off exponentially. Traditionally, they’re seen as mathematical artifacts that
describe probability amplitude “leaking” into forbidden regions. But in the transactional picture, these waves are part of the
handshake—they represent real (though non-energetic) components of the quantum process. They don’t carry power, but they do carry
phase, which is what ultimately determines quantum outcomes. That’s critical, because it shows that even non-propagating wave
components are physically meaningful when viewed through the lens of coherence across time.
So what carries this phase information? In quantum electrodynamics (QED), it’s the electromagnetic vector potential, written Aµ. This
field is more fundamental than the electric or magnetic field—it’s what actually determines the phase evolution of a charged particle.
Even when electric and magnetic fields are zero, Aµ can cause observable interference effects, as demonstrated in the Aharonov–Bohm
effect. That experiment confirms that quantum systems respond not to force fields directly, but to the underlying gauge potential that
encodes how phase shifts as particles move through space. This makes Aµ not just a mathematical convenience—it’s a real field, even if
it can’t be measured with classical instruments.
The reason this matters is that phase is where the information lives. The vector potential encodes subtle distinctions between otherwise
indistinguishable paths. If you change Aµ along a loop, you don’t change the energy, but you change the relative phase—and that can
shift the result of a quantum interference experiment. That’s why Aµ is central to any attempt to transmit information via quantum phase
without sending energy. In the context of the Transactional Interpretation, it's the medium of the handshake—an invisible but
consequential participant in every interaction.
But this goes further. In the strong and weak nuclear forces, the vector potential is generalized into something richer: a non-Abelian
gauge field. These fields not only respond to the presence of charges but also interact with themselves, creating complex dynamics and
internal symmetries. The phase information carried by these fields can influence not just individual particles, but entire families of
interactions, entanglements, and conserved quantities. And just like in QED, this structure is invisible to classical detectors—it’s only
detectable through interference, symmetry breaking, and conservation across boundaries.
Keeping these theories consistent requires the introduction of ghost fields—mathematical entities that cancel out unphysical degrees of
freedom during calculations. These “ghosts” don’t correspond to real particles; they only exist in internal loops of Feynman diagrams,
ensuring that when redundant gauge choices are summed over, the final result is unitary and consistent. Here’s where the analogy with
the Transactional Interpretation becomes rich: ghost fields and confirmation waves both serve structural roles. They’re not directly
observable, but they’re essential to ensuring that the theory only allows physically consistent events. They filter out contradictions and
leave behind only the solutions that satisfy global coherence.
Mathematically, this filtering is formalized in BRST cohomology, which selects the physical subspace of quantum field states. A state is
only considered “real” if it is annihilated by the BRST operator, but not the trivial result of acting on something else. This is
conceptually identical to the transactional idea that only matched offer–confirmation wave pairs can lead to real events; unmatched
waves remain virtual, unrealized. In both systems, reality emerges through consistency, not spontaneity.
So why does this matter? Because it shifts our understanding of what’s physically real. If Aµ and evanescent waves can influence
outcomes without carrying energy, then information doesn’t always ride on top of classical signals. It can be encoded in phase, in
boundary conditions, in topological loops that extend across time. This opens the door to new kinds of communication—like A-wave
signaling—that don’t violate energy conservation, but still transmit meaningful differences. It may offer new insights into quantum
memory, where information is stored not as voltage or current, but as structured phase over time. And it may allow us to test for
retrocausal effects, where choices in the future shift phase structures that influence present events—not in contradiction with relativity,
but as a deeper expression of symmetry across spacetime.
More broadly, this perspective provides a framework to unify the apparently separate domains of quantum mechanics, gauge theory, and
information theory. It says that the true substrate of quantum reality may not be particles or energy at all, but coherent patterns in
phase space, enforced by symmetry, shaped by boundary, and manifested as discrete, observable events. When interpreted this way,
every interaction is not just a moment, but a resonant structure—formed from the alignment of past and future, carried by invisible
fields, and resolved by the demands of global consistency. That’s not just a philosophical idea. It’s a physical framework with
experimental consequences, and a path forward for reimagining what it means to interact, to communicate, and to exist in quantum
spacetime.
