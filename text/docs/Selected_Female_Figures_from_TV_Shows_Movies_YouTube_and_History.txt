8     Conclusion

Altered Carbon, Continuum, The OA, Travelers), various Marvel films, as well as real-life or public personas

self-awareness about what personal qualities resonate most strongly for you. Whether you seek a pragmatic
ally, a visionary leader, a brilliant engineer, or a nurturing spirit, these sketches show a wide spectrum of
personalities, aptitudes, and drives.
