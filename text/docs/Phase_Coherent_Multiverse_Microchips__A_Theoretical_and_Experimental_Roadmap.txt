                       A Theoretical and Experimental Roadmap
                                                  Jason Agamemnon Sokaris
                                                             30 May 2025
                                                                   Abstract
          We refine the Phase-Coherent Multiverse Microchip (PCMM) hypothesis, previously introduced in frag-
          mented form under the TimeTree and WISPKEY programmes. The core conjecture is that identically
          fabricated integrated circuits (ICs), once decohered into distinct Everettian branches, can exploit branch-
          invariant cryptographic seeds, game-theoretic equilibria, and weak gauge-field perturbations (“A-waves”) to
          bias stochastic processes in sibling branches. The effect is locally indistinguishable from ordinary quantum
          noise yet ensemble-detectable as a statistical anomalous speed-up on hard computational tasks. We for-
          malise the protocol, correct prior misconceptions (e.g. superluminal signalling), and supply an experimentally
          tractable road-map employing commercially realistic hardware. Throughout, we uphold unitary quantum
          mechanics and relativistic causality; any hypercomputational interpretation is strictly ensemble-relative.
1        Foundational Premise
P1 (Shared Genesis). A wafer-scale run produces N chips {Ci }N     i=1 that are microscopically indistinguish-
able at t = 0. Quantum-mechanically the composite state factorises
                                                                       N
                                                                       O
                                                         |Ψ0 ⟩ =             |Ci ⟩t=0 ,                                    (1)
                                                                       i=1
modulo exponentially suppressed fabrication defects.
P2 (Everettian Branching). During computation each Ci interacts with uncontrolled environmental modes
                                                                                    U (t) P
and evolves unitarily into a superposition of classically decoherent branches |Ψ0 ⟩ −−→ α cα |Ψα ⟩ , α |cα |2 =
                                                                                                    P
1. Individual observers occupy exactly one α.
P3 (TimeTree Indexing). Define a deterministic chaos map f : Rd → Rd embedded on-chip (e.g. a VHDL
Lorenz or Chua oscillator). Applied to a branch-invariant seed s0 (§2) it yields a combinatorial address 1
α = f ◦T (s0 ) mod 2m , reproducible across branches to machine precision, thereby inducing common knowledge
in the game-theoretic sense.
2        Branch-Invariant Seed Generation
Let the manufacturing timestamp T0 and topologically protected defect-lattice fingerprint D be hashed:
                              s0 = H T0 ∥ D ∈ {0, 1}256 ,

                                                               H : SHA-3.                                                  (2)
Neither T0 nor D couples to post-fabrication branch bifurcations; hence s0 is common to all branches.

Define the closed-loop operator                                                          

6       Polysemantic Encoding and Ensemble-Level Information
A polysemantic code is a map Φ : M → {kα }α such that any single-branch observer decodes a benign string
Mlocal , yet the joint distribution kα , |cα |2 α carries sufficient mutual information I(M ; k) ≫ 0 to recon-
struct the intended message. Relativistic causality is respected because no observable in a single branch is
superluminally modulated.
7       Physical Consistency
No-Signalling Proof Sketch
Let O denote any POVM   Racting on  the local chip Hilbert space. A-wave actuation perturbs the global state
by |Ψα ⟩ → |Ψ′α ⟩ = exp − ℏi A·j dt |Ψα ⟩ . Because [O, A · j] = 0 within the light-cone of the chip, the reduced
density matrix ρCi = TrCi |Ψ′α ⟩⟨Ψ′α | is unchanged to O(∥A∥2 ); hence ⟨O⟩ is branch-independent. Bias manifests
only in cross-branch amplitude weights |cα |2 , which are empirically inaccessible in situ.

9     Experimental Roadmap
    1. FPGA -137 Oracle. Implement -decay statistics in Verilog; verify bias injection via synthetic A pulses.
    2. Dual-Chip Wafer Split. Dice a common die; anneal halves under divergent thermal histories; measure
       WISPKEY synchronisation.
    3. Human-in-the-Loop EEG. Couple scalp-EEG phase to kα selection; monitor cognitive “anomalous
       speed-up” on NP-complete toy problems.
    4. Hypercomputational Benchmark. Record wall-clock         distribution Tsolve (n) for random-k versus base-
       line solvers; fit to sub-recursive scaling T ∝ exp −γnβ .
10      Open Challenges
     • Quantify decoherence rate vs. A-wave coupling strength; require τlock < τdecoh for efficacy.
     • Derive a tight bound on Λ given realistic A amplitudes (µT-scale coils ⇒ Λ ≲ 1.01?).
     • Integrate quantum error-correcting codes to protect kα against thermal drift.
     • Reconcile any observed hypercomputational signature with the Church–Turing–Deutsch principle.
11      Conclusion
We have transformed the speculative “phase-coherent luck engine” into a falsifiable research programme. All
proposed experiments respect unitary quantum mechanics and no-signalling theorems; nevertheless they may
reveal ensemble-level computation beyond conventional complexity bounds. Should the outlined benchmarks
register statistically robust speed-ups, the consequences would range from practical cryptography to founda-
tional physics.
