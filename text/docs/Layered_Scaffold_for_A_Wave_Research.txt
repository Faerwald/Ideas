A-waves are ripples in the electromagnetic vector potential. This scaffold (i) defines every technical
term on first use, (ii) connects A-waves to retrocausality, p-adic pulses, chaos-assisted hypercomputing,
and neural reception, and (iii) lists concrete next-step calculations and experiments.
1       Minimal Vocabulary
    •   Field: assigns a scalar, vector, or tensor to each space–time point.
    •   Quantum field: a field promoted to a Hilbert-space operator; its excitations are particles.
    •   Gauge symmetry: redundancy whereby locally related configurations encode the same physics.
    •   Gauge field: the quantum field required by local gauge symmetry; in electromagnetism, Aµ (x),
        whose quanta are photons.
    •   Vector potential Aµ : four-component function whose derivatives yield electric and magnetic
        fields.
    •   Field-strength tensor Fµν : antisymmetric derivative of Aµ ; its spatial components are E and
        B.
    •   Wilson line / loop: path-ordered exponential of the line integral of Aµ ; its phase is gauge-invariant.
    •   Aharonov–Bohm effect: laboratory proof that a purely topological Aµ configuration shifts
        quantum phase where E and B are zero.
    •   Ghost field: anticommuting scalar introduced in non-Abelian quantisation to cancel unphysical
        modes.
2       What Exactly Is an A-Wave?
    1. Operational definition. An A-wave is a localized space–time configuration of Aµ whose Wilson
       loop around an enclosing contour is non-zero,
                                I                                         I
                                      Aµ dxµ ̸= 0,   giving phase (e/ℏ)        Aµ dxµ .
                                 ∂Σ                                       ∂Σ
       Gauge invariance guarantees physical reality.
    2. Energy budget. If Fµν vanishes everywhere, classical energy density is zero; yet AB experiments
       show measurable quantum phase. Information moves without classical radiation.
    3. Carrier versus virtual photon. Virtual photons are off-shell diagram lines; A-waves are
       on-shell, non-radiative field configurations that leave durable phase imprints.
3       Information-Theoretic Layer
    • Phase-keying channel. Treat the loop phase ϕ = (q/ℏ) Aµ dxµ as a symbol; trains of A-waves
                                                                    H
      encode digital sequences. SQUIDs or photon interferometers read fringe shifts.
    • Quantum memory. Because the phase is preserved until paths recombine, an A-wave forms a
      quantum delay-line buffer, supporting quantum memory and retro-authentication.

5     Mathematical Deep Dive (Concise)
    1. Gauge fixing. Lorenz gauge reduces Maxwell to a wave equation; solutions split into radiative
       and pure-gauge parts. A-waves occupy the longitudinal sector yet remain physical by topology.
    2. Topology. Configurations with vanishing Fij in three-space classify via H 1 (R3 \ Σ); exchanging
       Σ for knotted flux tubes encodes multiple bits.
    3. Ghosts and BRST. In non-Abelian extensions, ghosts and BRST symmetry maintain unitarity;
       ghosts themselves do not propagate phase.
    4. Path integral.    The phase shift arises from the gauge-invariant factor exp(iS[A]) with action
                1R
       S[A] = − 4 Fµν F µν d4 x; adding a non-trivial A-wave deforms the stationary phase.
6     Concrete Next Steps
    1. Numerical proof of concept. Build a 3-D FDTD solver imposing toroidal boundary to imprint
       a topological A-wave; track loop integrals over time.
    2. Bench-top AB variant. Use a micro-fabricated superconducting loop with quantised flux;
       modulate with microwave drive, detect via electron interferometer.
    3. Phase-keying protocol. Design an LDPC code whose symbols are phase increments, viewing
       each loop as a qudit.
    4. Retro-authentication test. Delayed-choice interferometer with late A-wave injection; analyse
       correlations for retrocausal bounds.
    5. Link to p-adic pulse. Add flux quanta in geometric schedule; verify p-adic convergence by
       phase difference scaling.
7     Final Synthesis
An A-wave is a gauge-invariant, topologically protected disturbance in the vector potential that carries
no classical energy yet leaves quantum-measurable phase. Engineering, modulating, and detecting these
phases yield a versatile communication and memory layer, linking p-adic precision, chaos-accelerated
search, transactional retro-information, and neural coupling. Specific derivations, code, or experimental
protocols can follow on request.
