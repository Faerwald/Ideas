Roadmap and First-Phase Execution: Earthquake Case
        ⟨Jason Agamemnon Sokaris | .F.A.E.R.W.A.L.D⟩
I. Immediate plan for the Earthquake case
 1. Baseline SOC failure model
    (a) Choose a tractable SOC scheme (e.g. Olami–Feder–Christensen mean-field).
    (b) Define the state variable σ(t) = accumulated tectonic stress and its loading rate r.
    (c) Specify the failure threshold σc and thereby the unperturbed event time
                                                        σc − σ(0)
                                                 t0 =             .
                                                            r
 2. Perturbation-to-time-shift mapping
    (a) Represent each tiny remote nudge u(τi ) as an incremental stress change δσi .
    (b) Linearise: a single δσ at time τ advances the failure by
                                                                 δσ
                                                       δt ≈         .
                                                                  r
    (c) For a distributed sequence {τi },
                                        X δσi           Z   t0
                                                    1
                                 ∆t ≈             =               GE (t0 − τ ) u(τ ) dτ,
                                            i
                                                r   r    −∞
        where GE is the stress-response kernel.
 3. Energy-scaling constraint
    (a) From the “Energy-Scaling Law” (Three Laws paper), relate ∥δσ∥ to the cognitive-control
        energy ∥u∥: δσ ≤ K ∥u∥p .
    (b) Thus derive an upper bound
                                                              K
                                                 |∆t| ≤         ∥u∥p .
                                                              r
 4. Parameter calibration & simulation setup
    (a) Select realistic tectonic parameters:
                                    r ∼ 10−2 MPa/yr,                σc ∼ 100 MPa.
    (b) Choose control-energy budget ∥u∥ and exponent p (from chaos-control literature).
    (c) Prepare to simulate on a single-fault, 1D slider-block model.
 5. Pathway framing (next stage)
    Once ∆t formula is in hand, we will layer in the pathway problem: chaining micro-nudges so that
    an agent is in a designated safe zone at the shifted rupture time.
                                                   1
II. Execution of Step A: Minimal SOC threshold model
1. State-equation
Let σ(t) denote accumulated stress on a fault, loaded at constant rate:
                                           σ̇(t) = r,         σ(0) = σ0 .
An earthquake triggers when σ(t) = σc . Thus
                                                         σc − σ0
                                               t0 =              .
                                                            r
2. Single-pulse perturbation
A cognitive nudge at time τ < t0 injects δσ so that
                                             (
                                               σ(t),      t < τ,
                                     σ̃(t) =
                                               σ(t) + δσ, t ≥ τ.
The new failure time tδ solves
                                                                                  δσ
                                 σ0 + r tδ + δσ = σc          =⇒      tδ = t0 −      .
                                                                                   r
Hence the advance
                                                                   δσ
                                             δt = t0 − tδ =           .
                                                                    r
3. Distributed impulses
For a continuous control signal u(τ ) coupled via a stress-response kernel GE , the total stress perturbation
at t0 is                                     Z  t0
                                      ∆σ =           GE (t0 − τ ) u(τ ) dτ,
                                              −∞
and thus
                                                     Z   t0
                                      ∆σ   1
                                 ∆t =    =                     GE (t0 − τ ) u(τ ) dτ.
                                       r   r            −∞
4. Energy-scaling bound
Invoking the Hypercomputational Energy-Scaling law:
                                                                            K
                                 ∆σ ≤ K ∥u∥p          =⇒         |∆t| ≤       ∥u∥p .
                                                                            r
III. Next micro-deliverables
  1. Specify GE (t). A reasonable choice is an exponential memory kernel
                                          GE (t) = exp(−λ t) (t ≥ 0),
      with damping rate λ fitted from aftershock decay statistics.
  2. Estimate the exponent p and prefactor K from Fradkov’s OGY perturbation results.
  3. Plot ∆t vs. ∥u∥ for plausible parameter ranges to visualise the control envelope.
