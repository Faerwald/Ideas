                        Hyperlearning Coherence
1. “1109 IQ” Tail–Probability Exercise
Using a modern deviation IQ scale with mean µ = 100 and standard deviation σ = 15,
                                       1109 − µ      1109 − 100
                                    z =           =              ≈ 67.27.
                                           σ             15
     For a one–sided Gaussian tail the associated probability is
                                                       
                              P (X ≥ 1109) = 12 erfc √z2 ≈ 1.7 × 10−985 ,
orders of magnitude below even the reciprocal of the baryon count of the observable universe (∼ 1080 ).
Instruments saturate near 160−200 IQ; thus the figure is a playful extrapolation, not a physically realisable
measurement.
   Practical reading. At z ≈ 67σ the psychometric construct itself breaks: sampling theory, biological
limits, and test calibrations all fail long before such an extreme is reached.

   A 20σ event is ∼ 1067 times less probable than obtaining 220 consecutive heads in fair coin-tossing. In
practice systematic errors eclipse such tiny likelihoods; the figure serves as an asserted confidence rather
than an empirically testable frequency.

                                 “1109 IQ”        1.7 × 10−985         67σ
   Even a 20σ confidence claim is a minor ripple compared to the 67σ extrapolation implicit in the
speculative IQ figure.
2.4 Bayesian Divergence
Personal observation of a 20σ coincidence supplies a likelihood ratio of ∼ 1078 in favour of the hypothesis
“such events are possible for me”. A single update step can thus swing a neutral prior into near-certainty
for the informed observer. Outsiders, lacking that data, rationally maintain scepticism.
2.5 Prescience vs. Intelligence
Let the effective information per decision be
                                     Htotal = Hpresent (I) + Hfuture (P ),
where I is raw cognitive throughput and P is prescient bandwidth. Whichever term dominates sets the
asymptotic performance ceiling. When P ≳ I, foresight “eclipses” further IQ-like gains.
2.6 Million-Thread Hyperlearning Sketch
   • Fan-out: N = 106 semi-independent threads, each τ = 3 h.
   • Learning per thread (optimistic): 1 bit s−1 consolidated ⇒ Kthread ≈ 1.08 × 104 bits.
   • Total haul: Ktotal ≈ 1.08 × 1010 bits (∼ 1.3 GiB).
   • Merge overhead: at least O(N log N ) conflict checks (≳ 2 × 107 ), so reintegration cost can dominate
     unless a high-fidelity coherence operator (e.g. the Pswap function) is realised.
   The split is information-feasible; the merge is the engineering challenge.
3. Synthesis
   • A 20σ event (white-board odds) is already beyond routine scientific falsification; a 67σ IQ extrapo-
     lation is farther still.
   • Bayesian updates explain how private evidence radically shifts an individual’s posterior while leaving
     the public consensus unchanged.
   • Practical leverage lies in whichever channel—prescient or cognitive—supplies the larger share of net
     Shannon information.
   • Hyperlearning by million-fold mind-split is bounded not by raw bandwidth but by the thermody-
     namics of coherent reintegration. The open problem is implementing a fault-tolerant, gauge-invariant
     merge operator, a current target for Oneiro Cybernetics.
