Below is a compressed “cross-walking” guide that lets you jump directly from each high-leverage motif in Gödel, Escher, Bach
(GEB) to the tight, code-centric expositions you asked for. I order the bridges by conceptual dependency, so if you move down the
list you will see how the big narrative threads in GEB collapse into the terse formal results spread across Mike James, Sipser,
CLRS, and (for asymptotic depth) Arora-Barak.
1. Strange Loops ⇄ Recursion & Self-Reference
    ●​ GEB anchor. Hofstadter’s archetype appears in the Endlessly Rising Canon and in Escher’s Waterfall discussion, where
       moving through “levels” returns you to the start in a single cycle.​
    ●​ Mike James. Chapter 16 (“Recursion”) demystifies the same loop with literal code and shows that every paradox reduces
       to an infinite recursion of state → ¬state.​
    ●​ Sipser. Index entries under self-loop and self-reference point to §8 (the Recursion Theorem) where the looping argument
       becomes a machine-indexed fixed-point.​
    ●​ CLRS / Complexity. Recurrences and induction in CLRS §2 give the algorithmic cost view, while Arora-Barak’s opening
       on padding shows how self-loop padding lifts NP to EXP.
2. Formal Systems → Gödelian Incompleteness
    ●​ GEB anchor. The liar-paradox walk-through transitions into Gödel’s pearl in Ch. XIV–XVII.​
    ●​ Mike James. Chapter 9 (“Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorem”) restates the proof in <20 pages, stripping away the
       dialogues. Use it immediately after you finish GEB’s Ch. XIV to see the same diagonalization written as a numbered
       derivation (James even cites GEB explicitly).​
    ●​ Sipser. §9.3 provides the minimal formal-language machinery (Gödel numbering, representability) you need to read
       modern undecidability papers.​
    ●​ Arora-Barak. Appendix A revisits incompleteness through proof-complexity lenses, letting you see why length-bounded
       proofs matter to P ≠ NP.
3. Computability & the Turing Paradigm
    ●​ GEB anchor. Ch. XIII introduces BlooP/FlooP/GlooP as playful stand-ins for primitive-recursive, μ-recursive, and
       partial-recursive functions.​
    ●​ Mike James. Ch. 3–4 give a direct, state-table definition of a single-tape Turing machine and derive the Halting Problem
       in less than ten lines of code.​
    ●​ Sipser. Figures in §3 lay out the standard TM state diagram, matching the formal seven-tuple notation you will find again
       in complexity texts.​
    ●​ CLRS. Only needed for algorithm/run-time practice once the model is fixed; see §35 (automata) for a concrete
       implementation angle.
4. The Halting Problem as Canonical Undecidability
    ●​ GEB dramatizes the Halting self-embed in the Record Player dialogue;​
    ●​ James treats it as a two-line reduction from recursion paradoxes to decision problems (Ch. 4);​
    ●​ Sipser §5 formalizes it via mapping reductions to ATM;​
    ●​ From there Arora-Barak turn it into the s-m n lemma that powers modern completeness proofs.
5. Complexity Classes & P vs NP
    ●​ GEB touches complexity only metaphorically, but once you see Strange Loops you are ready to recognise verification vs.
       construction dichotomies.​
    ●​ Mike James. Ch. 17 (“P = NP?”) sketches Cook–Levin and highlights SAT as a self-representing formula (a Gödel-lite
       call-back).​
    ●​ Sipser. Part III (§7–8) gives rigorous class definitions and reductions; use it as your baseline.​
    ●​ Arora-Barak. Ch. 2–3 connect NP, EXP, and NEXP by padding arguments; that generalises James’s narrative.
6. Kolmogorov Complexity & Information as Program Length
    ●​ GEB. The “Prime Numbers as Gödel’s Straw” anecdote foreshadows minimal-description-length.​
    ●​ James. Ch. 7 formalises K(x) as |π| for a universal TM and immediately proves Incompressibility (ties back to GEB’s
       infinity theme).​
    ●​ Arora-Barak. Later chapters translate K(x) bounds into pseudo-randomness lower bounds.
7. Infinity, Induction, and Diagonal Arguments
    ●​ GEB devotes Ch. IV & V to showing how infinite regress is encoded finitely.​
    ●​ Mike James. Ch. 6 covers countability vs. uncountability with Cantor’s diagonal—perfect drill material after GEB’s visual
       metaphors on infinity.​
    ●​ Sipser. §4 does the same with a strict set-theoretic proof style.
8. AI & Tangled Hierarchies
    ●​ GEB’s last quarter (Ch. XVIII–XX) speculates on AI as emergent Strange Loops.​
    ●​ Mike James ends with a short appendix on computability limits for learning machines, pointing back to recursion-based
       limitations.​
    ●​ Sipser & Complexity furnish the PAC-learning and circuit-lower-bound formalisms that operationalise Hofstadter’s
       philosophical reflections.
How to Read Efficiently
    1.​ Skim GEB chapters in the order listed above—ignore dialogues once you grasp the metaphor; the numbered sections
        and boxed summaries give all formal cues.​
    2.​ Immediately open the related Mike James chapter for the “show me the code / theorem” rendering; his prose is
        minimalist and aligns one-to-one with GEB’s big ideas.​
    3.​ Consolidate in Sipser to cement definitions and proof styles; jump to Arora-Barak only when you need asymptotic or
        randomness depth.​
    4.​ For algorithm design practice, flip to the mirroring CLRS section right after each Sipser proof; the exercise sets map
        abstract theory to concrete runtime.
Using this hop-map you can let Hofstadter supply the intuition, but spend your serious line-by-line time on James (first), then
Sipser, then the heavy complexity texts for any theorem you need in battle-ready form.
