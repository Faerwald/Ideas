The One Bad Relationship
Background and Vulnerability
I was thirty years old in 2020 when I experienced physical intimacy for the first time. Until then, I had never kissed
anyone or been close with anyone in a romantic way. I believed I could finally open up, share my secrets, and give
my trust to someone. Looking back, my eagerness to form a genuine connection made me more vulnerable than I
realized.
Manipulative Dynamics
From the start, there was no clear label on what we were. She would switch between saying we were “together”
and denying it. She ended things repeatedly, citing contradictory reasons each time. I was punished purposefully
regardless of what I did or said. Every boundary or rule she set shifted without warning, leaving me perpetu-
ally confused. When I tried to clarify, she would deny ever having said certain things and cast me as the one
misunderstanding. It became impossible to distinguish truth from manipulation.
Emotional and Physical Coercion
She used physical intimacy as a tool of control. There was never a moment of genuine affection; she refused
cuddling or any comforting touch. Each time we were intimate, she would abruptly change her mind afterward,
forcing me to adapt and drive her home. It felt like she deliberately set traps, then watched me struggle to keep
up with her ever-shifting needs. She drew satisfaction from my confusion and heartbreak, knowing full well how
inexperienced and eager to please I was.
Psychological Mistreatment
On top of the physical manipulation, she frequently canceled plans and refused to communicate honestly. If I
attempted to discuss my concerns, she shut down the conversation and gave me the silent treatment. I apologized
for things I never did, just to avoid conflict or loss. Over time, it became clear she enjoyed provoking my distress.
There was nothing accidental about the confusion she created; it was deliberate cruelty. Everything I thought I
understood would be flipped upside down the next day.
Aftermath, Fears, and Hope
In the wake of this experience, I struggled with feelings of worthlessness and a deep fear of intimacy. My mind kept
returning to those patterns, warning me it could happen again. Logically, I know not everyone is manipulative.
Still, I am cautious and sometimes overwhelmed by the memory of how my trust was violated. I want to rebuild
my confidence slowly, through small, safe gestures—holding hands, talking, and allowing myself time to feel secure.
If I find a caring partner, I believe true closeness can exist without the lies and cruelty I once experienced. It will
take patience, both from me and from anyone who wishes to be with me, but I am hopeful that real intimacy and
genuine love are possible.
