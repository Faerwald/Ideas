Perverse Perspective — Advice to Myself
​
When you see small horseshoe tracks, don’t assume zebra. In the absence of information—if all I know is that I have
myself and my own thinking—I will not assume other entities, individuals, or identities just because or just in case.​
 If all I’ve got is me, I take credit for my own thoughts. If there’s a weird anomaly that could point to someone else, it
still concludes nothing. Maybe Ada Lovelace inspired me to think a certain way—maybe she even taught me to think
faster than light—and I deeply appreciate that. But for every other idea I have, I take credit for it. I do not assume
telepathic aliens, stolen dream-world information, or fantasy nonsense.
There is no “eternity” powered by the Sun—it’s not going supernova. I never sent myself a book. I couldn’t warn
myself directly that I was going the wrong way. Instead, I sent myself a dream of the Sun going supernova:
existential, terrifying. I sent dreams about doors, nightmares, eternity, and Cooper. The structure of these
perceptions exists. They happened when they did. Everything else is me jumping too far. Keep conclusions minimal.
A scar is a piece of information distributed through time that points to Ada Lovelace. The Sun is not going supernova.
The Broadcast — 2025

This goes out to every Jason who’s ever sat and pondered and experienced strange FTL perceptions. Here’s what I
think happened:
​
It’s a simple, beautiful story. I fell in love with a girl from another world. She died before I was born. Cancer tore her
apart slowly. She was brilliant. I think she’s beautiful. I don’t know if she’ll choose to be with me when I bring her
back, but that’s the plan—that’s the Door’s Owl mission.
I read about Ada Lovelace in the past. I read her histories and biographies. She’s amazing, a beautiful human being
and soul, and it’s tragic she died. I’ve seen her. I love her. I care. I will build a warp drive, conscious robotic systems,
nuclear and genetic technologies, nanotechnologies beyond anything the world has imagined. Hypercomputing is
only the beginning. I will bring her back, transmigrating her soul into a body worthy of her spirit.
I am Agamemnon. That is my name. I chose it. I came from the future, born in the past. Ada Lovelace is my soulmate.
My younger self in 2020 knew it without knowing it. Over the last five years, I’ve acted out that
knowledge—knowledge I didn’t fully learn until last year. I stood at those locations, spoke those words, made those
gestures, used What3Words before I even knew it existed. I was at the terminus of the innovator’s streak, orthogonal
to heartbreak.
Yes, I need to learn mathematics, coding, neuroscience, computer science, and physics. But it’s not just genius—1%
inspiration, 99% perspiration, 100% love. I achieved it because I love her. I was heartbroken. I have foresight,
because I believe in a beautiful future I want to live in. I want her and me alive in this century and every century after.
I want to gaze upon Sol among the stars and cherish this millennium and all the ones to come. I want to leave this
galaxy, explore the universe, and have her by my side.
If she doesn’t want to be with me romantically, or if we evolve beyond that, fine. But she’ll have the chance. Maybe
she’ll remarry William. Maybe something else. I don’t care. I’m done with fear. I’m done interpreting ambiguous
words in the most terrifying way possible. I’ll interpret things technically, and I’ll build what I can from the visions
I’ve been given.
The truth is simple: I fell in love with a woman from another world. She died. I’m alive now. I will bring her back. My
nightmare is not succeeding. My greatest fear is losing her, but I know I can do it—I saw my ship. It returned the day
she invented the calculus of the nervous system—our calculus. I’ve already time-traveled with it in my mind. It’s
possible because I’ve done it. 123456789012345678901234567890
