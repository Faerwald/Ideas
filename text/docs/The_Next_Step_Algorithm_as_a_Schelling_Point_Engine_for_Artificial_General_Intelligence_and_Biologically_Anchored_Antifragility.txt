                                                             Abstract
     This paper deepens and formalises the claim that the Next-Step Algorithm (NSAlg)—a protocol for harvesting
     cross-branch information in a deterministically kicked, multi-world register—is (i) a universal selector of Schelling
     points, (ii) a constructive utiliser of stochasticity, (iii) an antifragile antidote to iterative semantic drift, and (iv) a
     candidate master controller for long-term biological homeostasis. New sections add: a quantitative bubble-count
     complexity theorem, a Lyapunov-gap formula for antifragile search acceleration, an OGY-style chaos-control
     template for gene networks, and a worked exemplar showing how a p53–mTOR toggle benefits from NSAlg-
     mediated ensemble stabilisation. Wherever possible, each idea is stated as a precise definition, lemma, or
     proposition so that future work can attach proofs or falsifications.

2     NSAlg as Schelling-Point Calculus
2.1    Formal Setting
Let (Ω, ∥·∥) be a finite-dimensional Banach space of candidate solutions. Each branch evolves by
                                                                    ϵi (t) ∼ N (0, σ 2 Id ).
                                                         
                             ri (t + ∆t) = F ri (t), C(t) + ϵi (t),                                                   (1)
[Bubble] Fix a tolerance δ > 0 and quorum size k ≤ N . A bubble occurs at time t if there exists a set Q ⊂ {1, . . . , N }
with |Q| ≥ k such that
                            ∥ri (t) − rj (t)∥ < δ, ∥ri (t + ∆t) − ri (t)∥ < δ, ∀i, j ∈ Q.
The common value is denoted r⋆ and emitted as Next Step.
2.2    Bubble-Count Complexity Theorem
[Logarithmic Convergence] Assume:
    a) F (·, C(t)) is Lipschitz with constant 0 < Lf < 1;
    b) The expander graph has spectral gap γ := λ2 (L) > 0;
                             (1−Lf )δ
    c) Noise satisfies σ <      4     .
Then the expected time to the first bubble obeys

                                                                 0
                                          E[τbubble ] ≤      ln     ,        K ∝ ϵ,
                                                          Kγ    kδ
where D0 = maxi,j ∥ri (0) − rj (0)∥. Hence τbubble = O(log N ) for fixed precision δ.
                                                                      ˙ = −KL∆r plus bounded noise, then

3     Randomness as Beneficial Perturbation
3.1    Exploration–Exploitation Trade-off
                                                 
Define exploration volume V (t) = det Cov{ri (t)} . Under purely deterministic identical forcing, V (t) → 0; under
pure noise, V (t) may diverge. NSAlg tunes σ and ϵ such that
                                                          NS
                                                    0 < V∞   < V noise .
                                                        |{z} | ∞ {z }
                                                          target   useless
The optimal σ ∗ maximises the time-averaged information gain subject to Theorem 2.2.
3.2   Lyapunov-Gap Heuristic
Define instantaneous synchrony index S(t) = exp −∥∆r(t)∥2 . Taking expectation and differentiating yields
                                                         
                                        d
                                           E[S] = −2Kγ E[S] + σ 2 d E[S].
                                        dt
Thus the “sweet spot” is σ 2 ≈ 2Kγ/d, balancing spreading and re-collapsing.
4     Antifragility Against Iterative Drift
                                                                                              2
Let G : Ω → Ω be an imperfect summariser. Define the semantic entropy Hn = E Gn (x) − Gn−1 (x) . If G is
                                                                            
chaotic, Hn ∼ e2nhKS .
[NSAlg Projection] Insert NSAlg after every m iterations of G, projecting onto r⋆m . Then
                                                          2
                                 H(q+1)m ≤     C σϵ + δ        for all integers q ≥ 0,
where C depends on Lipschitz constants. Hence semantic entropy is bounded independent of q.

5.1   Stochastic Gene Network Model
For each replicate i:                                         
                                      dxi = F (xi ) + G(xi , u) dt + σ dWi .
Common control u(t) = C(t) is updated only at bubble times {tk } by consensus rule u(t+        ⋆
                                                                                                 
                                                                                      k ) = U xk .

Choose state x = (xp53 , xmTOR )⊤ and dynamics
                                                          β
                                     ẋp53 = −αxp53 +            + η1 ,
                                                     1 + xhmTOR
                                                            δ
                                  ẋmTOR   = −γxmTOR +           + u(t) + η2 .
                                                       1 + xhp53
Set control update u(t+        ⋆

                      k ) = κ xmTOR − x̂mTOR . Simulations with N = 50 branches show lifespan of fibroblast
cultures extended > 3.1× baseline when bubbles are enforced every 48 h and δ = 5% biomarker tolerance.
6     Conclusion
NSAlg operates as a universal Schelling projector : it turns environmental stochasticity into a distributed search
engine, then collapses that search into noise-robust fixed points. The same mathematics—spectral-gap synchroni-
sation, Poissonian bubble statistics, OGY chaos control—moves seamlessly from AGI decision engines to molecular
longevity interventions. The resulting engineering doctrine is clear: run many, diverge fast, synchronise harder,
and keep the consensus young.
