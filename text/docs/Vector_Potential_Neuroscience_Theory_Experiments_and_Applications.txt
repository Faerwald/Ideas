                                                     Abstract
         This comprehensive document explores the possibility that the magnetic vector potential, A, plays
     a nontrivial role in neural dynamics and brain function. Historically, neuroscience has centered on
     local electric fields, ionic currents, and membrane potentials. We propose extending these classi-
     cal models to include gauge-theoretic concepts inspired by quantum electrodynamics (QED), con-
     densed matter physics, and advanced control theory. By considering mechanisms that might couple
     A to ion channel gating, protein conformations, network synchronization, and large-scale neuronal
     ensembles, we highlight potential avenues for subtle yet possibly measurable effects. We discuss how
     small but systematic gauge-based phase shifts could influence neural excitability, chaos control, and
     high-dimensional attractors in brain networks. We then outline candidate experimental setups (e.g.,
     specialized coil arrangements, nanotechnology-enabled patch-clamp, quantum emulation) and offer a
     speculative outlook on how such phenomena could inform open questions in consciousness, large-scale
     neural modeling, and next-generation neuromorphic hardware. This report unifies both a “textbook”
     organization (multiple chapters and sections) with the cohesive structure of a scientific article, ensuring
     that no significant theoretical or experimental detail is lost.
   *Preface and Motivation
1.1 Historical Context: Electromagnetism in Biology
Electromagnetism has played a pivotal role in the history of neuroscience. Early experiments by Galvani
and Volta highlighted bioelectric phenomena underlying muscle and nerve activity. Over the following cen-
turies, breakthroughs in electrophysiology demonstrated how transmembrane potentials, ionic gradients,
and synaptic transmission form the backbone of neural signal processing. Yet, one aspect of electromag-
netism remains comparatively underexplored in biology: the magnetic vector potential, A.
    As quantum mechanics and gauge theory evolved, it became evident that A is not just a mathematical
convenience. In quantum electrodynamics (QED), potentials take on physical significance, especially in
phenomena like the Aharonov–Bohm effect, where phase shifts arise even if the local magnetic field B
vanishes. This observation raises the question: could subtle, gauge-theoretic effects also be relevant in
biology, specifically in neurons?
1.2 The Role of Gauge Theories in Modern Physics
Gauge theories undergird our fundamental understanding of particle physics, unifying electromagnetic,
weak, and strong interactions in the Standard Model. The electromagnetic four-potential (ϕ, A) is central
                                                         1
to these theories, encoding global phase relationships and topological effects. Parallel developments in
condensed matter physics (e.g., topological insulators, superconductors) reinforce the importance of gauge
potentials in understanding nontrivial phase structure in macroscopic systems.
   Could some analog—albeit weaker—apply in biology? Although neuronal environments are warm,
wet, and noisy, the staggering complexity and high dimensionality of neural networks suggest that even
small perturbations could get amplified. This framework, dubbed Vector Potential Neuroscience, explores
whether gauge potentials might subtly modulate ion channel gating, protein conformations, and neural
network synchronization.
1.3 Outline and Conceptual Roadmap
This document is organized into multiple chapters (Parts I–IV). Along the way, it integrates mathematical
modeling, quantum-field perspectives, advanced experimental ideas, and speculation on topological or
gravitational analogies. While we reference “chapters” to maintain a coherent textbook-like flow, readers
can also view the content as a long-form paper with section headings that explore each theme in depth:
    • Part I (Chapters I–II): Theoretical underpinnings, from classical electromagnetism and gauge trans-
      formations to fundamental neuroscience.
    • Part II (Chapters 3–6): Advanced theoretical constructs, bridging QED with neuronal dynamics;
      extended Hodgkin–Huxley models; potential molecular mechanisms for A-coupling.
    • Part III (Chapters 7–9): Experimental paradigms, advanced modeling, and interdisciplinary ap-
      proaches (control theory, category theory, quantum emulation).
    • Part IV (Chapter IV): Final synthesis, addressing large-scale brain function, potential therapeutic
      uses, philosophical implications, and open questions.

Introduction to Vector Potential Neuroscience
1     Emergence of the Magnetic Vector Potential in Electromag-
      netism
Classical electromagnetism expresses the electric field E and the magnetic field B in terms of the scalar
potential ϕ and the vector potential A:
                                                ∂A
                                   E = −∇ϕ −       ,     B = ∇ × A.                                  (1)
                                                ∂t
While A often appears as a mathematical device in Maxwell’s equations, modern physics reveals its deeper
role. Under a gauge transformation defined by some scalar function Λ(r, t):
                                                                  ∂Λ
                                    A → A + ∇Λ,         ϕ → ϕ−        ,                                (2)
                                                                   ∂t
the fields E and B remain invariant classically. However, the Aharonov–Bohm effect [1] demonstrates that
quantum phase shifts can arise purely from the integral of A along a path, even when B = 0 in that region.
This underscores the physically real, gauge-invariant role of A.
                                                    2
1.1    Biological Relevance of Gauge Potentials
In standard biophysics, neurons are modeled primarily in terms of electric fields and ionic currents. One
might presume that A is negligible or irrelevant. Yet, if certain molecular or quantum-coherent structures
in neurons respond to gauge-invariant phase factors, then A could in principle impact gating transitions
or protein conformational changes. Such effects might be quite small but could be amplified cumulatively
across many channels or over time.
2     Molecular Neuroscience and Ion Channel Basics
Neurons communicate through transient changes in membrane potential. The classical Hodgkin–Huxley
(HH) model captures key features of the action potential:
                                     dVm
                                Cm       = −Iion (Vm , g) + Isyn + Iext ,                              (3)
                                      dt
where Cm is membrane capacitance, Iion denotes ionic currents through voltage-gated channels, and Isyn ,
Iext represent synaptic and external inputs, respectively.
2.1    Ion Channels and Conformational States
Ion channels typically toggle among open, closed, and inactivated states. Their gating variables follow
first-order kinetics:
                                    dx
                                        = αx (Vm ) (1 − x) − βx (Vm ) x.                             (4)
                                    dt
In standard HH theory, these kinetics depend on transmembrane electric fields. Vector Potential Neu-
roscience suggests exploring additional terms that incorporate A, potentially modifying gating rates or
energy barriers in a small but systematic fashion.
3     Bridging QED and Neuronal Dynamics
3.1    Canonical Momentum and Effective Hamiltonians
At the quantum level, charged particles experience a canonical momentum p − qA. For ions moving
through a channel or gating charges shifting within a protein domain, we can hypothesize a simplified
Hamiltonian:
                                                (p̂ − qA)2
                                          Ĥ =             + U (r).                                   (5)
                                                    2m
While thermal noise in neurons is significant, partial quantum coherence has been observed in other
biomolecular systems (e.g., photosynthetic complexes). If neuronal channels possess analogous features or
if repeated gating yields a cumulative effect, A might become biologically relevant.
3.2    Constraints from Thermal Noise and Decoherence
Skeptics point out that at physiological temperatures (≈ 310 K), quantum coherence is rapidly destroyed.
Nonetheless, some specialized biomolecular complexes manage partial coherence. If neurons employ com-
partments, waveguide-like structures, or resonance phenomena, phase factors introduced by A might in-
fluence gating transitions in ways that are small per single event but non-negligible en masse.
                                                    3
4     Chaos, Control, and High-Dimensional Attractors
Neural networks, especially in cortex, can exhibit complex or chaotic dynamics. Let x ∈ Rn be a state
vector capturing membrane potentials, gating variables, and synaptic currents. Then
                                              ẋ = F(x, A).                                             (6)
Because of strong nonlinearity, the brain may operate near critical regimes where small perturbations can
shift the entire attractor landscape. An external parameter like A (if controllable) might be used to tune
or even control chaotic behavior, reminiscent of OGY or Pyragas techniques for stabilizing or destabilizing
specific orbits.
4.1    Control of Chaos in Neuronal Ensembles
Chaotic neural ensembles exhibit sensitive dependence on initial conditions. By modulating A(t) in real
time—presuming we could generate such signals precisely—one might move the brain from pathological
states (epileptic bursts) to more functional activity regimes. Although challenging, advanced coil arrange-
ments and real-time feedback could in principle implement such chaos control via gauge fields.
5     Conclusion to Part I
These chapters highlight the notion of Vector Potential Neuroscience as a novel extension of standard
neuronal models. By introducing A into gating kinetics and by invoking quantum electrodynamics, we set
the stage for exploring micro-to-macro neural phenomena that might otherwise be overlooked in classical
analyses. In Part II, we delve into more detailed mechanisms, toy models, and potential experimental
signatures.
Part II
Expanded Molecular Mechanisms and
Advanced Modeling
Molecular Mechanisms and Multiscale Modeling
6     Introduction
Part II expands on plausible molecular pathways whereby A might interact with neuronal components.
We then investigate how these microscopic influences could scale to network-level phenomena. Recent
findings in quantum biology (e.g., excitonic transport, spin chemistry) motivate us to search for analogous
structures in neurons.
7     Plausible Molecular Coupling Mechanisms
7.1    Ion Channels and the Canonical Momentum Revisited
Voltage-gated channels often contain segments (like the S4 helix in Na+ channels) with embedded charges.
Suppose qg is an effective gating charge that travels distance d upon activation. A time-varying vector
                                                    4
potential A(t) might contribute to the potential energy:
                                                     Z
                                           ∆U ≈ qg Ȧ · dr.                                               (7)
Even if small relative to kB T , repeated gating across billions of channels over many cycles might accumulate
an effect.
7.2    Dipole Moments and Protein Conformations
Many transmembrane proteins exhibit large dipole moments, which can couple to electromagnetic fields.
Gauge effects can manifest in regions where B ≈ 0 but A ̸= 0. Conformational changes—e.g., from closed
to open states—could be subtly biased by these gauge-induced phase factors.
7.3    Quantum Vacuum and Virtual Particle Exchange
In advanced QED formalisms, boundaries (e.g., channel pores) alter the vacuum field modes. Slight changes
in A could shift vacuum energy densities, akin to Casimir-like effects. Though speculative, analogies exist
in microcavity physics. Neuronal channel structures, if suitably arranged, might experience small but
non-zero gauge-induced modifications to barrier heights.
8     A Toy Model: Modified Hodgkin–Huxley Equations
8.1    Incorporating A in Gating Kinetics
A minimal extension to Hodgkin–Huxley might write:
                              dVm                   
                         Cm       = − INa + IK + IL + Iext ,                                              (8)
                               dt
                               dm
                                  = αm (Vm ) (1 − m) − βm (Vm ) m + χm Γ(A, Vm ).                         (9)
                               dt
Here, χm is a coupling constant, and Γ(A, Vm ) is a function (or functional) capturing how A modifies
gating. One could imagine a path integral or semiclassical argument to estimate Γ. Numerical simulations
might then reveal whether the presence of A can shift spike thresholds, alter firing rates, or induce new
bifurcations.
8.2    Steady-State Analysis and Bifurcations
Treating ∥A∥ as a control parameter, one could map out how fixed points or oscillatory solutions in the
HH model respond. New Hopf bifurcations or period-doubling routes to chaos could appear at critical
values of A. While this is speculative, it is computationally testable in the near term.
9     Emergent Network Phenomena
9.1    High-Dimensional Attractor Dynamics
In networks of N neurons, each with multiple gating variables, the dimensionality quickly becomes large
(≈ 4N for a simple HH scheme). Including A-dependence might add further degrees of freedom. If A acts
like a “global coupling” or systematically shifts gating transitions, new collective patterns—e.g., traveling
waves, synchronous clusters, or chimera states—could emerge.
                                                      5
9.2    Synchronization and Phase Locking
Slight modifications to conduction delays or channel kinetics can cause abrupt transitions between syn-
chronous and asynchronous regimes. If A modifies gating variables or resonance conditions, the network
might spontaneously shift into new synchronization patterns. This parallels the Kuramoto model in which
an additional phase term can drive a system from incoherence to phase-locked states.
9.3    Chaos Control in Large-Scale Circuits
From an engineering perspective, controlling chaos in large neural circuits might be easier if one has an
external knob—like A—that influences excitability. Well-known methods (OGY, Pyragas) use minimal
feedback to stabilize or destabilize periodic orbits in a chaotic attractor. If A(t) can be modulated in real
time, then gauge-based control might have therapeutic implications (e.g., epilepsy, tremor disorders) or
even be harnessed to enhance certain cognitive processes.
10     Concluding Remarks for Part II
We have examined candidate molecular mechanisms and outlined how A might show up in extended
Hodgkin–Huxley models. While the existence of such effects remains speculative, the open door for quan-
tum and gauge-theoretic phenomena in biology justifies deeper theoretical and experimental scrutiny.
Part III explores how we might design experiments to detect (or refute) A-based neural effects, and how
advanced modeling or even quantum simulations might help.

Experimental Paradigms for Vector Potential Neuroscience
11     Designing A-Sensitive Experiments
11.1     Helmholtz Coils, Modified Solenoids, and Toroidal Fields
Conventional Helmholtz coil setups create near-uniform magnetic fields, but not necessarily regions of
nonzero A with minimal B. Toroidal solenoids, carefully managed for fringe fields, could approximate
B ≈ 0 but with significant A. Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices (SQUIDs) can monitor
local magnetic fields down to femto-tesla levels, giving indirect readouts of A.
11.2     Magnetic Shielding, Cryogenics, and Noise Reduction
Because any A-induced shifts are likely very small, external electromagnetic noise must be minimized.
Magnetically shielded rooms (Mu-metal enclosures), multi-stage cryogenic systems, and low-noise amplifiers
are key. Experimental protocols may also involve pulsed A sequences (inspired by NMR techniques) to
detect phase-coherent gating responses.

12     Nanoscience Methods for Ion Channel Investigations
12.1    Single-Channel Patch-Clamp with Integrated Coils
Patch-clamp remains the gold standard for measuring individual ion channel currents. Integrating micro-
coils or solenoids near the pipette tip could produce local variations in A. Repeated measurements of
single-channel events (open probability, gating kinetics) under different A amplitudes/frequencies might
reveal gating anomalies—or place strong upper bounds on any gauge-mediated effects.
12.2    Metamaterials and Sub-wavelength Resonators
Metamaterials engineered for specific µr or ϵr can localize electromagnetic fields more tightly than con-
ventional coils. Sub-wavelength resonators near channel-rich areas of the membrane might achieve high A
intensities with minimal classical B. These setups could isolate gauge-phase effects from Lorentz forces or
heating artifacts.
13     Quantum Simulation and Emulation of Neuronal Dynamics
13.1    Lattice Gauge Theory Approaches
Quantum simulators (cold atoms, trapped ions) can implement lattice gauge Hamiltonians, where links
encode A-dependent phases. Mapping Hodgkin–Huxley-like excitations onto these lattices might let us
artificially “turn up” the gauge coupling to test for topological phases or robust wavefronts. While not a
direct simulation of real neurons, these analogies can guide experiments and highlight parameter regimes
worth investigating in vitro or in vivo.
13.2    Quantum Neural Networks and Gauge-Dependent Cost Functions
Quantum neural networks (QNNs) can represent spiking states in qubit amplitudes. If we incorporate
gauge-dependent phase factors into a QNN’s cost function, we can train it on data from classical extended
HH simulations that include A. Once trained, the QNN might extrapolate to parameter regimes beyond
classical tractability, predicting emergent phenomena such as stable wave fronts or new synchronization
patterns influenced by A.
14     Gravity, Gravitomagnetism, and Potential Couplings
14.1    Brief Review of Gravitomagnetism
In weak-field general relativity, a mass current (moving mass distribution) can create a gravitomagnetic
field Ag , analogous to A in electromagnetism. Although Ag is typically many orders of magnitude weaker,
certain unification theories (Kaluza–Klein) or quantum gravity proposals hint at possible cross-couplings.
14.2    Overlaps Between A and Ag
Though purely speculative, if neural microstructures are exquisitely sensitive to phase relationships, even
small gravitational-like vector potentials might have some effect over large spatiotemporal scales. This
raises provocative questions about how any gauge field, no matter how weak, might become relevant in
biological complexity.

15     Cybernetic Feedback Loops and Control of Chaotic Brain
       Activity
15.1    Principles of Cybernetic Physics in Complex Systems
Cybernetic physics examines how to regulate high-dimensional, continuous dynamical systems via feed-
back loops. A system with state x(t) can be steered by adjusting a parameter A(t). If A modifies
gating or synaptic couplings, then real-time feedback might direct the brain from one attractor to an-
other—potentially bridging normal and pathological regimes or shaping cognitive states.
15.2    OGY/Pyragas Control Using A
In Ott-Grebogi-Yorke (OGY) control, small feedback signals stabilize an unstable periodic orbit in a chaotic
attractor. Replacing the typical control variable with A suggests:
                                       A(t) = A0 + K [ x(t) − x∗ ],                                    (10)
where x∗ is a desired reference manifold. Although implementing fine-tuned A(t) in practice is challenging,
simulations can reveal how gauge-based feedback might reorganize network activity.
15.3    Information-Theoretic Measures for Closed-Loop Regulation
Beyond stabilizing or quenching chaos, one could define a complexity measure (Lyapunov spectrum, corre-
lation dimension, or integrated information) and dynamically adjust A(t) to maintain near-critical states.
This merges computational neuroscience and advanced cybernetics: the brain remains poised at an optimal
complexity “sweet spot,” possibly linked to cognition and consciousness.
16     Category-Theoretic Approaches to Brain Networks
16.1    Functors, Natural Transformations, and Gauge Structure
Category theory offers a high-level formalism in which neurons or microcircuits are objects, and synaptic or
gating transformations are morphisms. Gauge transformations that shift A → A+∇Λ might correspond to
natural transformations between functors describing local or global network configurations. This viewpoint
can unify local gating changes with network-scale reconfiguration in a mathematically rigorous way.
16.2    Compositional Hierarchies in Multi-Scale Brain Models
From single-ion channels up to entire cortical regions, neural systems exhibit compositional hierarchies.
Embedding gauge-based HH models into a category ensures that gauge invariance is tracked consistently
across each scale. Whether these category-theoretic pictures yield testable predictions remains to be
seen, but they sharpen the conceptual link between local A variations and emergent large-scale network
structures.
Merged Alternate Material: Advanced Theoretical and Experi-
mental Paradigms
An alternative but more mathematically rigorous approach incorporates:
                                                     8
   • Explicit Path Integral Approaches: Ion channel gating under A, analyzing phase accumulation
     in semiclassical expansions.
   • Lattice Gauge Simulations: Using bosonic/fermionic degrees of freedom to represent neuronal
     excitability in quantum computing platforms.
   • Gauge-Invariant Control Theory: Lyapunov functionals invariant under A → A + ∇Λ, ensuring
     physical consistency in chaos control loops.
   • Category-Theoretic Diagrams: Tracking how local gating transformations (functors) compose
     into entire network reconfigurations (natural transformations).
These ideas extend the conceptual and computational framework needed to test Vector Potential Neuro-
science at multiple scales.

Theoretical Synthesis and Emerging Paradigms
17     Gauge Invariance, Topological Phases, and Brain Function
17.1    Connecting Gauge Theory to Large-Scale Neural Dynamics
Previous chapters highlight the hypothesis that A may exert subtle influences in neuronal systems. In
classical physics, gauge transformations leave E and B invariant, yet in quantum contexts, they produce
real phase shifts. If neural microdomains or specialized structures harness partial coherence, A-dependent
phase might accumulate across channels, influencing large-scale neural dynamics.
17.2    Implications for Synaptic Plasticity and Learning
Standard models of plasticity (Hebbian, STDP) focus on local voltage or calcium signals. If gating rates or
channel states respond to A-induced phases, plasticity could become a global phenomenon, linking distant
regions of the brain in a coherent manner. This might open new routes for rapid, system-wide plastic
changes, analogous to neuromodulator waves or glial regulation.
17.3    Topological Phases in Neural Lattices
Topologically protected states—familiar from quantum Hall systems or topological insulators—are robust
against local perturbations. By analogy, large neural ensembles might exhibit “topologically protected”
patterns if A encodes nontrivial boundary conditions. Lattice gauge simulations (see Chapter III) can test
whether such topological phases appear in neuron-like systems.

18     Reassessing Biological Noise: Quantum and Relativistic Frame-
       works
18.1    From Thermal Fluctuations to Quantum Corrections
While classical neuroscience emphasizes the destructive role of thermal noise, certain biological systems
(e.g., photosynthetic complexes) exhibit partial quantum coherence. If neurons exploit microdomains or
timescales where gauge phases can accumulate before decoherence sets in, then A might produce small
but functionally significant shifts over many gating events.
18.2    Gravitomagnetism Revisited
Chapter III introduced the concept of a gravitational vector potential Ag . Though orders of magni-
tude weaker than electromagnetic A, hypothetical synergy might arise in unified field theories. Whether
neuronal complexity amplifies these effects is a far-reaching speculative question, but it exemplifies the
broader principle that any gauge field could, in theory, matter if the system is sufficiently sensitive and
high-dimensional.
19     Towards a Cybernetics of Consciousness?
19.1    Cybernetic Feedback and Control of Brain States
If consciousness is grounded in self-organizing neural processes, controlling A in real time (even in small
ways) could, in theory, modulate integrative phenomena (e.g., gamma synchrony, default mode network).
This viewpoint aligns with cybernetic neuroscience—a union of advanced control theory and large-scale
neural modeling. In pathological conditions (epilepsy, major depression), subtle electromagnetic/gauge-
based stimulation might restore normal attractor basins.
19.2    Information-Theoretic and Complexity Perspectives
The idea of maintaining near-critical states in the brain suggests a complexity measure Ω(x, t) (e.g.,
Lyapunov exponents, integrated information). One might define a feedback control law:
                                                                  
                                  A(t) = A0 + K Ωdesired − Ω(x(t)) ,                             (11)
dynamically keeping the network near a high-complexity “edge of chaos.” If feasible, this could yield novel
ways to tune cognitive function or treat neurological disorders.
19.3    Speculations on Gauge-Invariant Consciousness
Could consciousness be partially gauge-invariant? That is, unaffected by local gauge transformations but
potentially altered by global or topological changes in A? While such ideas verge on the philosophical,
they resonate with emergent or pancomputational theories proposing that conscious experience is tied to

20     Connections to Other Frontiers: Quantum Gravity, Holog-
       raphy, and More
20.1    Quantum Gravity Analogies and Brain Tissue
Some researchers have speculated on analogies between the holographic principle (AdS/CFT) and certain
high-dimensional properties of cortical networks. In these analogies, A might correspond to boundary
conditions controlling the neural manifold’s “bulk” states. Though beyond mainstream neuroscience, these
parallels emphasize how gauge-invariant phenomena bridge high-energy physics and emergent biology.
20.2    Holographic or Topological Data Analyses
Topological data analysis (TDA) methods, like persistent homology, are now used to find nontrivial shapes
in high-dimensional neural recordings. If gauge-phase constraints create stable “holes” or loops in neural
trajectory space, TDA might detect them as topologically distinct classes. This extends beyond simple
correlation-based analyses, hinting at hidden geometry in neural state spaces shaped by A.
20.3    Next-Generation Neuromorphic Hardware
Neuromorphic architectures that encode gauge-like interactions (e.g., via superconducting qubits, flux
loops) might achieve robust computations resilient to local noise—mimicking the topological protection
known in quantum computing. Such devices would operationalize Vector Potential Neuroscience concepts,
potentially enabling exotic memory functions or novel “phase-encoded” computing paradigms that harness
gauge invariance.
Concluding Remarks and Future Outlook
Unification and Next Steps
From molecular-scale gating to network-level attractors, Vector Potential Neuroscience brings gauge-
theoretic tools to the forefront, challenging the assumption that A is irrelevant in biology. Modern instru-
mentation (SQUIDs, advanced coil designs, metamaterials) and quantum simulation platforms now make
it feasible to test these ideas directly—either by detecting small gating anomalies or by actively trying to
modulate neural states with A pulses.
Open Questions
  1. Experimental Feasibility: Can we generate sufficiently precise regions of nontrivial A with minimal
     B? Can such effects be measured above noise?
  2. Quantum vs. Classical: Are any observed phenomena genuinely quantum, or can classical field
     interactions explain them?
  3. Gravity and Other Forces: Does linearized gravity (Ag ) or other fundamental fields play a role, or is
     that purely theoretical curiosity?
  4. Medical Applications: Could A-based neurostimulation be harnessed for epilepsy, depression, or other
     pathologies if proven effective?
  5. Consciousness and Gauge Invariance: Does the brain’s integrative function depend on topological
     or gauge-theoretic structures? Is consciousness invariant under local gauge transformations?
                                                    11
Final Thoughts
This report/paper has surveyed the breadth of Vector Potential Neuroscience, merging fundamental physics
and advanced neuroscience. Whether or not A fundamentally reshapes our understanding of the brain,
these concepts prompt deeper reflection on the interplay between gauge fields and living systems. If
confirmed, they could open new vistas in control theory, quantum biology, and the very nature of cognition,
suggesting that life’s “electrical tapestry” might be subtly embroidered with gauge-theoretic threads.
