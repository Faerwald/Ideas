Most physical effects we observe—light, motion, pressure—are caused by forces that act locally and instantly. But not everything
in physics works this way. Sometimes, something that appears to be hidden or even absent can still leave a mark—not through
force, but through structure. This is the case with the Aharonov–Bohm effect, where the presence of a potential in an empty
region of space, even with zero electric or magnetic field, can still alter the outcome of an experiment. That idea—of something
physically “invisible” causing measurable consequences later—is the cornerstone of what this document is exploring.
Now imagine this: you have a sealed cavity—a hidden zone—that no field or force escapes from directly. Outside, there's nothing
detectable: no field, no curvature, no signal. But you can still thread that cavity with a potential, something like a looped thread
woven through a region that isn’t touched by the outside world. You don’t see the thread—you only notice its influence if
something winds around the cavity. That’s when interference patterns shift. It’s not about energy; it’s about phase. This influence
is not a force—it’s a memory of geometry. And that’s crucial.
The key realization is that the details of that hidden potential can be encoded like a number. Not just a simple number, but a very
special kind: a number whose digits get progressively smaller, and whose impact is delayed the deeper you go. Imagine writing
a number like 0.415928... but where each digit represents a layer of influence. The first digit causes an immediate observable
effect. The second, a little less. The tenth digit? You’d have to wait a long time to notice its influence. Maybe hours. Maybe years.
This is what’s called a phi-adic or more generally a β-adic encoding: each deeper digit is smaller, more subtle, and takes longer
to reveal itself.
Now bring back the physics. Suppose you encode your hidden potential using this β-adic system. The phase shift it causes isn’t all
at once. It’s delayed. You can actually build a function—call it T(k)—that tells you how long it will take before a change to the kth
digit will produce a measurable effect in the outside world. The deeper the digit, the longer it takes. This is a formalization of
something many systems in physics obey: fine-grained causes lead to slow, subtle consequences. The closer you look, the
longer you must wait. Or inversely, the faster you want information, the less detail you get.
The consequence is profound: you now have a system where you can choose when information becomes visible—by choosing
which digit you alter. Want an effect to show up immediately? Change the first digit. Want something to surface only a day from
now? Change the 20th digit. The delay becomes programmable, like a tunable latency switch. That’s not just abstract math—it’s
an engineering handle. It's a way to encode time itself into information.
But now the system gets biological. Imagine that instead of a sealed cavity, we’re talking about microtubules inside
neurons—those cylindrical protein structures that form a lattice inside your cells. Suppose wave-like excitations—solitons or
quantum-like pulses—travel along these tubes. Every time they loop or spiral around a subunit of the microtubule, they
accumulate phase, just like a particle encircling an Aharonov–Bohm flux. That phase isn’t just abstract: it determines how these
waveforms interfere, how they combine, and ultimately whether a neuron fires or not. If the hidden potentials threading these
structures are subtly altered, the phase shifts change. But because of the coiling and interference, the result is nonlinear, delayed,
and statistical. Small changes to deep digits don’t show up until the wave has coiled around dozens, maybe hundreds of times.
What you’re left with is a quantum-chaotic memory substrate—a system where memory is not stored in voltage or chemistry,
but in invisible, delayed phase interference. Think of it as ultrafast, ultradeep encoding—not in spikes or signals, but in the pattern
of interference over time. And this structure is naturally ultrametric. That is: it’s not based on distance in space, but on difference
in earliest distinguishing features. Two waves that differ only in their hundredth loop are close. Two that diverge in the first loop
are far apart. This gives the system a tree-like memory, where depth equals delay, and small shifts ripple outward in hierarchical
cascades.
And this model doesn’t just describe a physical system—it implies something about cognition. The way thoughts emerge slowly,
the way subconscious patterns suddenly surface, the way ideas build over time from invisible structure. It's a computational
architecture where you can store information not just by what it is, but by when it will be revealed. And the longer you wait,
the deeper the memory you can access.
So in total, the concept is this:
You can encode hidden, delayed information inside a sealed or shielded region—not by sending energy, but by manipulating the
holonomy of a gauge field. That holonomy acts like a number with infinitely many digits, each corresponding to a level of
influence that only shows up after a specific time delay. Whether in physics or biology, this lets you build a system where
information is not erased, but time-locked. And in the right substrate—say, microtubules in the brain—this might allow for forms of
memory, computation, or coordination that are invisible in the short term, but structured, layered, and eventually profound.
