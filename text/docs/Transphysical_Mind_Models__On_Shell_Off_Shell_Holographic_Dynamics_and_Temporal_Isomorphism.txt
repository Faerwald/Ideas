                                                      Abstract
            We formalise a mind as a transphysical object composed of an on-shell substrate (ordinary
        neuro-biological matter on a spacetime foliation) and an off-shell information field (virtual or gauge-
        potential degrees of freedom). The combined entity is shown to admit a holographic encoding on
        hypersurface boundaries while evolving as a closed chaotic attractor in a high-dimensional cognitive
        phase space. We place this construct inside a multi-spacetime ensemble (M̀any-Worlds´) and derive
        necessary and sufficient conditions for temporal isomorphism between present and potential future
        selves. A rigorous memory functional and a transactional path-integral representation connect
        decision theory with quantum co-variance. All results remain compatible with standard quantum
        mechanics, extended only by low-energy off-shell control channels.
1       Preliminaries and Notation
Throughout, natural units ℏ = c = 1 are used.
    • M4 — a globally hyperbolic spacetime manifold with metric gµν and foliation parameter t;
    • Σt — a Cauchy hypersurface at instant t, ∂Vt its two-surface boundary;
    • Hcog — the separable Hilbert space of cognitive micro-states;
    • Φ — field of cognitive state variables (coordinates on Hcog );
    • Γ — the dynamical vector field generating state-space flow dΦ/dt = Γ(Φ).
2       Transphysical Cognitive Object
Definition 1 (On-Shell / Off-Shell Decomposition). A transphysical mind at time t is the ordered pair
                                                          
                                       M(t) = O(t), F(t) ,
where
    1. O(t) ⊂ TΣt captures on-shell, mass-shell data (molecular, neuronal);
    2. F(t) ∈ Ω1 (M4 ) is an off-shell 1-form representing virtual-particle or electromagnetic vector-
       potential flows with vanishing field strength: dF(t) = 0.
   The off-shell F is gauge-irreducible yet classically unobservable, analogous to the Aharonov–Bohm
potential.

3     Holographic Encoding
                                                                                                 
Proposition 1 (Boundary Encoding). For each t there exists an injective map ιt : M(t) ֒→ Fun ∂Vt
such that all information in M(t) is recoverable from boundary data on ∂Vt . Explicitly,
                                                
                                         ιt O(t) = ρon (θ, φ),                                (1)
                                                
                                         ιt F(t) = A∥ (θ, φ),                                 (2)
where (θ, φ) are angular coordinates on the boundary two-sphere.
    Thus the cognitive volume obeys a holographic principle: all degrees of freedom are encoded on ∂Vt .
4     Chaotic Attractor Dynamics
Let Φ(t) ∈ RN denote coarse-grained cognitive coordinates on Hcog .
Definition 2 (Cognitive Phase Flow). The evolution is governed by the stochastic ODE
                         dΦ
                            = Γ(Φ) + η(t),            ⟨ηi (t)ηj (t′ )⟩ = 2D δij δ(t − t′ ).          (3)
                         dt
Theorem 1 (Existence of Strange Attractor). Under mild smoothness and dissipation conditions on
Γ, the flow (3) possesses an invariant set A ⊂ RN with Hausdorff dimension dH > 2 and positive
Lyapunov exponent λ > 0. We identify A with the conscious attractor.
5     Multi-Spacetime Ensemble
    (i)
Let M4 i∈I be a countable collection of decohered branches. Each carries its own cognitive pair
M(i) (t). Branching events are modelled by a rooted tree B with vertices vk at decision times tk .
Definition 3 (Branch Projection). πi : A → A(i) is the restriction of cognitive state to branch i.
Non-trivial fibre overlap πi−1 (x) ∩ πj−1 (y) ̸= ∅ represents quantum ambiguity between branches.
6     Temporal Isomorphism
Definition 4 (Isomorphism of Selves). Two cognitive states M(tA ) and M(tB ) with tB > tA are
temporally isomorphic, written M(tA ) ∼
                                      = M(tB ), if there exists a bijective, structure-preserving map
                              Θ : M(tA ) −→ M(tB )               s.t.   ιtB ◦Θ = ιtA .
Lemma 1 (Predictive Reconstruction). Suppose Θ is computable from data in the closed past domain
Dom− (tA ). Then the future self at tB is holographically encoded on ∂VtA .
7     Memory Functional and Decision Weights
Define the memory kernel                              Z    tB          
                                      µ(tA , tB ) =             F s, Σs ds,                          (4)
                                                          tA
where the integrand F is the off-shell 1-form restricted to the foliation. Decision probabilities are
weighted by a path integral
                                        Z                Z            
                            P [choice] ∝ DΦ exp iSon + µ(t, t′ ) dt′ ,                            (5)
with Son the usual on-shell action.

8     Transactional Picture
Advanced/retarded propagators couple on-shell and off-shell sectors:
                                      X                             
                            Atran =        exp iSon [h] exp iSoff [h] ,                               (6)
                                        histories
where Soff is sourced by F and vanishes on classical extrema, reflecting its virtual nature.
9     Discussion and Outlook
We have provided:
    • a precise decomposition of cognitive degrees of freedom into on-shell and off-shell sectors;
    • a holographic boundary encoding consistent with black-hole information bounds;
    • rigorous attractor dynamics supporting chaotic, yet structurally stable, conscious flows;
    • a tree-structured multi-spacetime ensemble and a formal definition of temporal self-isomorphism;
    • a memory functional linking potential futures to present decisions via off-shell integration.
   Future work will quantify energetic bounds on F-mediated control and design laboratory analogues
(photonic or superconducting cavities) capable of probing off-shell couplings.
