1. Retro-split possibility
     Can one deliberately trigger a retro-causal multiverse split, i.e. create branch differentiation that
     propagates “backwards” so earlier events differ across emergent histories?
  2. Re-interference conditions
     Given two histories that have already decohered, under what physical circumstances can they
     regain the capacity for quantum interference?
  3. Hyper-interference
     Is a form of “hyperquantum” interference—beyond ordinary unitary overlap—conceivable, and
     could it be engineered?
Aspect                Technical considerations
Everettian            In the Many-Worlds picture, “splits” are not caused; they are ubiquitous
baseline              results of unitary evolution + decoherence. A retro-split would mean
                      manipulating the global state so that amplitudes which were previously
                      coincident in the remote past become distinguishable now.
Time-symmetric        Two-state-vector formalism (Aharonov, Bergmann & Lebowitz) and
formalisms            consistent-histories show that post-selection can bias earlier
                      amplitudes without causal paradoxes. Practical implementation
                      demands (i) preparing an entangled system, (ii) later post-selecting a
                      rare outcome, and (iii) isolating the degrees of freedom that carry
                      information backward via weak values.
Closed timelike       Post-selected teleportation circuits simulate CTC logic. They
curves via post-      effectively yield histories in which earlier qubits adopt values
selection (Lloyd      consistent with a later constraint. The cost is exponentially small
et al., 2011)         success probability; decoherence kills scalability.
Thermodynamic         All “retro” tricks rely on extreme fine-graining: entropy must be pumped
cost                  out to keep coherences reversible. Any macroscopic apparatus quickly
                      leaks which-branch information to an environment of ≳10²⁴ modes,
                      making a controlled retro-split practically impossible.
Bottom line           In principle allowable within standard quantum mechanics via carefully
                      engineered pre- and post-selection; in practice the probability scales
                      like exp(−γN) where N is the number of environmental bits you must
                      erase, so laboratory-scale retro-splits are effectively forbidden.
                                                                                                             4/12
2   Re-Interference (Recoherence) Conditions
Interference amplitude∝ ​⟨ψ1​∣ρenv​∣ψ2​⟩ ​
 Criterion           Requirements to make that overlap non-zero again
 Microscopic         Decoherence scales with system–environment coupling g and time t:
 isolation           γ∼g2t. For photons in a cavity or nuclear spins in ultra-cold solids, one
                     can reverse the unitary and erase “which-path” records (quantum eraser,
                     spin-echo).
 Full                To recohere macroscopic branches, you must (i) locate every
 environmental       environmental mode entangled with the system and (ii) apply the inverse
 control             unitary. Practically impossible beyond ≈ 30 qubits; the required
                     information is dispersed at light-speed.
 Quantum             QEC protects logical qubits by decoupling them from the environment,
 error-              not by reversing decoherence. Re-interference is like perfect decoding
 correction          after total leakage—scales exponentially with lost entropy.
 analogy
 Relational          Even if perfect recoherence cannot be done globally, partial interference
 framing             can be engineered in a larger Hilbert space where decohered histories
                     become orthogonal subspaces of a bigger code. This motivates “inter-
                     universal processors” that work only on protected sub-systems.
 Bottom line         Microscale: feasible (labs routinely erase which-path info for < 10⁴
                     photons / ions). Macroscale: requires complete environment reversal →
                     infeasible except perhaps near a black-hole horizon where environment
                     = Hawking modes (a thought experiment).
 Hypothesis      Assessment
 Non-linear      Any deterministic non-linear term in the Schrödinger eq. would allow branch
 extensions      signalling and “Everett phone” effects. Empirical tests have constrained
 (Weinberg       such non-linearities to <10−20 eV; they would break thermodynamic

 Indefinite      Process-matrix formalism (Oreshkov, Costa, Brukner) allows superpositions

 Topological     Spin-foam path integrals sum over entire 4-geometries. Interference

 Hypothesis       Assessment
 Post-            Generalised-probability theories permit stronger-than-quantum interference
 quantum          (e.g., higher-order Sorkin levels). No experimental evidence; would likely
 models           violate Tsirelson’s bound and permit supra-quantum computation.
 (GPTs)
 Bottom line      Hyperquantum interference remains speculative. All empirically consistent
                  frameworks (unitary QM, linear process matrices, path integrals) reduce to
                  standard Hilbert-space overlap. Exceeding that without contradiction would
                  demand new physics that still respects no-signalling and thermodynamic
                  arrow—an open frontier, not an engineering blueprint.

 Exploit hyper-        Needs post-quantum              Conceptual only; no laboratory handle
 interference          theory; no evidence
Hence an inter-universal processor would have to:
   1. Restrict computation to protected microscopic subspaces (error-corrected qubits) that never
      fully decohere.
   2. Use post-selection or entanglement distillation to bias amplitude weights (retro-style) rather
      than re-merge macroscopic histories.
   3. Accept that “cooperative cross-history influence” is only achievable as correlated selection
      effects—not as two-way messaging—until physics beyond linear QM is demonstrated.

        Okay, the first thing that I see before reading any farther is that the first core question
        was not properly understood. What I meant was a retrocausal perturbation, touching the
        past from the future. Any touch, interaction, or observation with the past may or may not
                                                                                                       6/12
     cause a splitting akin to when any other decision may lead to a split or whatever usually
     we think of as the cause for when a branch occurs. I don't know. Usually we talk about
     coin flips and random events, but I'm trying to understand things more in terms of how
     David Deutsch understood them, because I think his take is more accurate than the
     usual talks about the multiverse, which I think a lot of people don't know what they're
     talking about and they're just parroting each other. But the first is wrong. You did not
     understand what I was really getting at. I didn't mean anything propagating backwards
     or in reverse time. What I meant was, instead of the usual something that causes a split
     down multiple branches from some event that everything branches forward from there
     like a coin flip, I meant looking at the past, looking at the history, touching it somehow,
     and retroactively causing a split where you would be on one of those branches, but
     there'd be other branches that branch forward from the place that you touch, and that
     touch would be reaching backwards across time. So that's what I meant by retrocausal.
  1. Retro-split possibility (clarified)
     Can a future measurement, decision, or other “touch” on an existing history create new branches
     at some earlier time, so that multiple forward-evolving histories now diverge from that past
     event?
  2. Re-interference conditions
     If two histories have already decohered, under what physical circumstances could they regain
     quantum-interference capability?
  3. Hyper-interference
     Is a type of interference stronger or more general than ordinary Hilbert-space overlap
     conceivable, and could it be engineered?
Concept           Analysis
Everettian        In the Heisenberg-picture exposition Deutsch uses in “The Structure of
ontology          the Multiverse,” there is already a continuum of branches for every
(Deutsch)         physically allowed amplitude arxiv.org . Nothing we do in the future
                  creates new past branches; it merely selects which pre-existing
                  amplitude our future experience will correlate with.
Post-             A strong measurement at t2​followed by post-selection on a rare outcome
selection         effectively “filters” the branch ensemble so that only those histories whose
viewpoint         prior micro-state can evolve into that outcome survive in the observer’s
                  record. Operationally it looks like a retro-split, but no amplitude is added
                  or duplicated; unwanted amplitudes are discarded by conditioning.
                                                                                                       7/12
 Concept                Analysis
 Weak-value             Weak measurements combined with post-selection (Aharonov’s two-state-
 steering               vector formalism) let us bias pointer shifts that depend on both past and
                        future boundary conditions. These correlations are exponentially fragile;
                        for macroscopic systems the success probability ∼e−γN where N is the
                        number of entangled environmental bits.
 Decoherence            To “touch” a macroscopic past event you would need to erase every
 barrier                which-path record that environment has stored since that event. Once
                        those records have thermalized, the required work exceeds kB​Tln2 per
                        entangled bit—astronomical for ordinary scenarios.
 Bottom line            Formally allowed via post-selection (no law of physics forbids those
                        amplitudes), but engineering a noticeable retro-split is infeasible: you
                        cannot amplify it to the classical scale without first reversing large-scale
                        decoherence, which collapses into the next question.

 Requirement        Feasible Regime                                  Obstacles
 Verdict            Re-interference is possible only while
                    decoherence is partial and engineered to
                    be reversible. Once macroscopic
                    entanglement is dispersed into
                    uncontrolled modes, recoherence is
                    operationally impossible.
 Candidate idea       Status

 Conclusion           No empirically supported framework yet exceeds standard linear
                      Hilbert-space interference while preserving no-signalling and
                      thermodynamic consistency. “Hyper-interference” remains conjectural.
Overall Synthesis for Your Engineering Intuitions
   1. You cannot “write” new amplitudes into the past; you can only condition on amplitudes that
      were always present.
   2. Recohering macroscopically separated histories demands reversing entropy growth—possible
      in principle for mesoscopic, fully controlled systems, hopeless for everyday scales.
   3. Hyper-interference would require physics beyond linear quantum mechanics; current bounds
      leave no operational handle.
Hence an inter-universal processor would most plausibly exploit error-corrected, still-coherent
subspaces plus carefully designed post-selection to bias outcome statistics—leveraging what
Deutsch calls constructor theory rather than literal retro-editing of macroscopic history.

Unified Treatment of the Three Core Questions
Below merges all analytical points from the two previous drafts—nothing removed, everything
consolidated.
   1. Retro-split possibility
      Can a future act of measurement/selection “touch” an existing history so that new branches
      diverge at some earlier time?
   2. Re-interference (recoherence) conditions
      After two histories have decohered, under what physical circumstances could they regain
      quantum-interference capability?
   3. Hyper-interference
      Is a stronger-than-standard (post-quantum) interference conceivable, and could it be
      engineered?

 Mechanism            Details & Obstacles
 Everettian           All allowed amplitudes exist ab initio; “splits” are not created but
 baseline             selected. A retro-split therefore means biasing which pre-existing
 (Deutsch)            amplitude our future state aligns with.
 Pre- & post-         Strong measurement at t2​with post-selection on a rare outcome filters
 selection            the branch ensemble so that only those micro-histories consistent with
                      that outcome remain in the observer’s record. Looks retro-causal yet
                      adds no amplitude.

 Mechanism               Details & Obstacles
 Decoherence             Once environment stores classical information, amplitudes become
 barrier                 orthogonal; selection can prune but cannot magnify the suppressed
                         branches to classical scale without reversing entropy growth.
 Bottom line             Formally permitted by standard QM (no law forbids such amplitudes);
                         practically infeasible beyond mesoscopic experiments because the
                         required post-selection probability and entropy-reversal cost scale
                         exponentially with system size. You cannot “write” new amplitudes into

 Verdict               Re-interference is routine for partially entangled,
                       engineered systems; effectively impossible for
                       genuinely macroscopic, thermally coupled
                       histories.

Conclusion                No experimentally supported framework surpasses Hilbert-
                          space linearity while obeying no-signalling and the second law.
                          “Hyper-interference” remains speculative.
