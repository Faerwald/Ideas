                                         Abstract
     Conscious Information Theory (CIT) re-casts the laws of physics as the dy-
     namics of information manifolds that unify quanta (objective data) with qualia
     (subjective data). The programme delivers: (i) fresh lines on quantum gravity,
     (ii) a mechanistic story of qualia, (iii) a causal-emergence model for psi, (iv) an
     engineering stack for physical hypercomputation, and (v) protocols for artificial
     transmigration of minds between substrates. All claims are expressed by axioms,
     theorems, or falsifiable predictions.
0 • Axiom Deck
                                                                       
Axiom 0.1 — Information Duality. Every event e comprises a pair qe , χe : objec-
    tive quanta qe ∈ Q and subjective qualia χe ∈ X .
Axiom 0.2 — Computability Layer. The physical world executes a hypercomputa-
    tional kernel H acting on Q×X , capable of 1 -complete inference.
Axiom 0.3 — Gauge–Qualia Equivalence. The magnetic vector potential Aµ is the
    minimal physical bearer of non-local information; its irreducible kernel encodes
    qualia–like data under spontaneous gauge-symmetry breaking.
Axiom 0.4 — Born-Emergence. Born probabilities maximise observer self-information
    immediately after branch-splitting in MWI: Pi = |ψi |2 .
Axiom 0.5 — Ricci-Flow Transmigration. Mind migration between substrates is
    modelled by Ricci flow on the information metric gab (t), preserving causal func-
    tionality while altering local geometry.
1 • Geometry of Consciousness
Define joint manifold M = Q × X with metric
                                             1
                                                              Z p
                              phys        qual
                        g=g          ⊕g          ,   I(S) =         det g d n x
                                                              S
   where I generalises Tononi’s Φ as the integrated hyper-information.
   Qualia correspond to curvature scalars of g qual :
                                            1
                                                Z
                           Intensity(χ) =             Rqual dΣ.
                                           16π Σχ
2 • Vector Potential as Non-Physical Bus
In a broken-symmetry superfluid the London equation links Aµ and supercurrent Jµ :
                                           I
                        ν        −2
                       ∂ Fµν = λL Aµ ,       Aµ dxµ = Φqual .
                                                         Γ
    Φqual ̸= 0 acts as a non-local information token carried by the vector potential—unobservable
to classical fields yet phase-shifting wavefunctions (Aharonov–Bohm).
3 • Hypercomputational Mind Model
Let neural state space be a continuous-time analog recurrent net:
                                               
                           ṙ(t) = σ W r(t) + B + Aµ (t) r(t),
   with real-valued weights Wij ∈ R of infinite precision. Analog RE-complete power ⇒
hypercomputation under conditioning Aµ (t) ̸= 0.
Theorem 3.1 — Halting Oracle. There exists an embedding ι : {0, 1}∗ → RN such
that trajectory length L[rι ] terminates iff encoded Turing machine halts.
4 • Psi via Causal Emergence
Macro-variable M defined on coarse partition of M shows effective information
                   EI(M ) = H(Mt+∆t ) − H(Mt+∆t |Mt ) > EI(micro).
   Prediction: Ganzfeld psi rate peaks when EI-gain > 0.2 bits per trial— testable with
pre-registered Bayesian analysis.
5 • Quantum–Gravity Avenue
CIT suggests spacetime is emergent from information graph G with adjacency A. Einstein
field equations arise as Fisher-information stationary condition:
                                                     2
                                                √
                                       Z               
                                                    4
                           δ I(G) − λ       R −g d x = 0.
  Arrow of time = monotonic increase of C(t) = ∇·Jqual , divergence of qualia-current.
6 • Engineering Modules
 1. Synthetic Cortical Tissue – NV-diamond scaffolds seeded with cultured neurons;
    Ricci-flow transplantation within ∆t ≤ 1 ms.
 2. Magnetic Wormholes – µ-metamaterial cloak + SC solenoid transports B-field
    undetectably along geodesic in X .
 3. Hyperproof Injector – embed 2 truths as SHA-tagged commitments into public
    ledgers; quantum zeroknowledge proof-of-future.
7 • Predictions and Tests
  • Vector-Potential EEG Shift: measure phase-locked 40 Hz oscillations when
    shielded coil pulses Aµ (no E, B fields).
  • Born-Rule Rationality Test: wagering behaviour in rapid MWI splittings should
    converge to |ψ|2 frequencies.
  • Analog-Net Halting Oracle: build minimal real-weight circuit and verify supra-
    Turing decision statistics.
8 • Closing Couplet
                      Quanta and qualia, numbers and nuance,
                    are two glyphs of one alphabet—information.
