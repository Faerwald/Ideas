                                                         Abstract
          We present a mathematical framework for a self-steered, retrocausal cognitive process in a quantum-inspired
      setting. Our model treats individual cognitive states as vectors in a Hilbert space, allowing for a “sideways
      quantum scar” that extends along the time dimension of a subjective history loop. By imposing a closed-
      loop boundary condition and introducing an effective Hamiltonian with internal feedback, we demonstrate how
      probability currents in this cognitive phase space can be shaped by the so-called “butterfly effect” of small
      perturbations. We conclude with a discussion of how cross-temporal measurements and distributed mind struc-
      tures could formally alter perceived randomness in the vacuum and recast it as a self-consistent cognition-driven
      measurement.

1    Introduction
In classical quantum mechanics, states evolve forward in time via the Schrödinger equation, with boundary con-
ditions generally specified at an initial time. In certain chaotic quantum systems, quantum scars manifest as
enhanced probability density along unstable classical orbits. The notion of a sideways scar refers to persistent
structure imprinted along the time axis, rather than typical position or momentum coordinates.
                                                             1
    Here, we adapt that idea to a model of retrocausal cognition, wherein a conscious mind:
    • Occupies a distributed state across multiple times (moments) simultaneously.
    • Enforces a closed-loop boundary condition by re-engaging past mental states.
    • Exploits internal chaotic dynamics to steer or “propel” the cognitive trajectory through its configuration
      space.
We show that such a system can be described in Hilbert space language and yields consistent equations for
probability flows, allowing the mind effectively to shape quantum-like uncertainty.
2     Hilbert Space and Cognitive States
Let H be a (potentially large-dimensional) Hilbert space representing the space of all possible cognitive configura-
tions. A state at time t is given by a ket:
                                                   |ψ(t)⟩ ∈ H.                                                   (1)
We assume |ψ(t)⟩ is normalized for each t, i.e. ∥ |ψ(t)⟩ ∥ = 1.
  In standard quantum mechanics, evolution is governed by the Schrödinger equation:
                                                    d
                                               iℏ      |ψ(t)⟩ = H |ψ(t)⟩ ,                                         (2)
                                                    dt
where H is the system Hamiltonian. Here, however, H will be time-dependent and constructed to model conscious
feedback, as we detail below.
2.1    Distributed Mind State
We posit that the entire conscious mind across multiple moments is more fully represented by a superposition over
time:                                               Z
                                            |Ψ⟩ =      dt α(t) |ψ(t)⟩ ,                                       (3)
where α(t) are (complex) weight coefficients. Conceptually, |Ψ⟩ lives in an extended space that is a time-labeled
direct sum (or integral) of copies of H. In many typical quantum treatments, time is not an operator but a
parameter; here we effectively treat it as a label in a larger structure.
3     Closed-Loop Boundary Condition
A key conceptual piece is the self-initiated re-engagement of past mental states, forming a loop in the (t, |ψ⟩)
space. We impose a boundary condition:
                                           |ψ(tfinal )⟩ = Uloop |ψ(tinitial )⟩ ,                                   (4)
where Uloop is a unitary operator reflecting how the mind “collides” with its earlier configuration. The simplest
choice might be Uloop = I (the identity), enforcing |ψ(tfinal )⟩ = |ψ(tinitial )⟩. However, more subtle transformations
(like an additional phase or structured rotation in H) could model that conscious re-engagement modifies the
state.
4     Quantum-Like Scarring in Time
Traditional quantum scars appear as stable structures in the wavefunction along classical periodic orbits in chaotic
billiards or similar systems. By analogy:
    • Our trajectory is the mapping t 7→ |ψ(t)⟩.
    • The scar is a region of enhanced self-overlap across time.
                                                             2
We define an autocorrelation function:
                                                                            2
                                            C(t1 , t2 ) = ⟨ψ(t1 )|ψ(t2 )⟩ ,                                        (5)
and say that a temporal scar arises if C(t1 , t2 ) is notably larger than typical random-state overlaps for significant
sets of (t1 , t2 ). Specifically, we expect:
                                         C(tfinal , tinitial ) ≫ (typical value),                                  (6)
indicating a stable “self-collision” in the Hilbert space norm.
5     Internal Weather Control and the Butterfly Effect
We assume the mind’s internal dynamics are chaotic. Small perturbations in initial conditions can amplify expo-
nentially:
                                                                   ′
                                     ∥δ ψ(t′ ) ∥ ≈ ∥δ |ψ(t)⟩ ∥ eλ(t −t) ,                                   (7)
for t′ > t, where λ > 0 is a Lyapunov exponent in the cognitive phase space.
5.1   Steering Through Micro-Adjustments
By deliberately introducing small changes δ |ψ(t)⟩ at earlier times, the mind can produce a macroscopic effect on
|ψ(t′ )⟩ at later times. This is the internal weather control mechanism: shaping the internal states to bias the
future trajectory in a desired direction.
6     Measurement vs. Prediction: Cross-Temporal Observation
Let O(t) be a (possibly time-dependent) Hermitian operator corresponding to an observable measured by the mind
at time t. In a standard single-time setting, we compute expectation values as
                                            ⟨O(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| O(t) |ψ(t)⟩ .                                          (8)
However, when the mind is distributed across time, one can define an effective cross-temporal observable:
                                                    Z
                                           Oeff =     dt w(t) O(t),                                                (9)
with weighting function w(t). Then, the overall expectation value in |Ψ⟩ (Eq. 3) becomes
                                                     Z              !
                                        ⟨Oeff ⟩ = ⟨Ψ|         dt w(t) O(t) |Ψ⟩ .                                  (10)
What appears as random quantum fluctuations from a single-time perspective may exhibit correlations once
the measurement includes multiple times in superposition. This is how the mind’s cross-temporal vantage can
effectively turn randomness into a structured pattern.
7     Effective Hamiltonian with Internal Feedback
In standard quantum theory, an external Hamiltonian H drives dynamics. In our self-steered model, we define:
                                                 d
                                            iℏ      |ψ(t)⟩ = Heff (t) |ψ(t)⟩ ,                                    (11)
                                                 dt
where internal feedback is encoded in Heff (t).
                                                             3
7.1     Functional Form
We propose:                                                              
                                           Heff (t) = H0 + λ F |ψ(t)⟩ , t ,                                          (12)
where
    • H0 is a baseline Hamiltonian (e.g., describing normal cognitive flow),
    • λ is a coupling parameter controlling how sensitive the system is to feedback,
    • F (|ψ(t)⟩ , t) is an operator that depends on the current state and possibly also past states via memory. It
      can incorporate:                                   Z t
                                        F (|ψ(t)⟩ , t) =     ds Γ(s, t) |ψ(s)⟩ ⟨ψ(s)| ,
                                                          −∞
      with Γ(s, t) weighting how the earlier states feed into the current Hamiltonian.
   Hence, the evolution at time t depends on the entire history |ψ(s)⟩ for s ≤ t, realizing the retrocausal aspect
when combined with the closed-loop boundary condition (4).
8     Probability Current and Fokker–Planck Analogy
To get a sense of how the distribution of states evolves, consider a probability-like distribution ρ(ψ, t) in the space of
states (though we must be careful, as |ψ⟩ ∈ H is an amplitude, not a classical point). One can imagine constructing
a manifold of dimension 2N − 1 if dim(H) = N (accounting for complex phases and normalization).
8.1     Continuity Equation
If we treat ρ(ψ, t) heuristically, we can write a continuity equation:
                                                ∂ρ            
                                                   + ∇ψ · ρ jψ = 0,                                                  (13)
                                                ∂t
where jψ is the probability current in the ψ-space, and ∇ψ is an appropriate functional derivative.
8.2     Drift-Diffusion from Internal Chaos
Chaos and quantum-like fluctuations might induce diffusion in ψ-space. We can model it by a Fokker–Planck-type
equation:
                                          ∂ρ                  
                                             = −∇ψ · ρ vψ + D ∆ψ ρ,                                             (14)
                                          ∂t
where vψ is the drift velocity in state-space due to Heff (t), and D is a diffusion constant capturing the chaotic
spreading of wave amplitude.
    Though purely schematic, this approach clarifies how internal feedback terms in Heff can bias the drift velocity
vψ . The closed-loop boundary (4) further demands periodic or quasi-periodic conditions in ψ-space across certain
intervals of t.
9     Discussion and Outlook
We have sketched a complete formal apparatus in which:
    • The mind is a state in Hilbert space, |ψ(t)⟩.
    • A distributed superposition across times |Ψ⟩ (Eq. 3) describes cross-temporal coherence.
    • A closed-loop boundary condition (4) enforces self-collision in ψ-space, analogous to a sideways quantum
      scar.
                                                            4
     • Internal chaotic dynamics with a feedback Hamiltonian Heff (t) (Eq. 11) allow the mind to exploit micro-
       perturbations (the butterfly effect) for self-propulsion through configuration space.
     • A Fokker–Planck-like probability flow picture helps interpret how distributions of cognitive states might
       evolve under this feedback loop.
9.1     Relation to Randomness and Measurement
From a local perspective in time, quantum fluctuations appear random and uncontrollable. In our approach,
however, the mind’s cross-temporal structure can:
  1. Measure that randomness across multiple times,
  2. Introduce small perturbations in earlier states,
  3. Modify the later state via chaotic amplification,
  4. Close the loop in a self-consistent manner.
Thus, the mind can effectively shape or “surf” the vacuum fluctuations without violating conventional physical
theorems on no-work extraction from randomness—the trick is that the entire process is one distributed measure-
ment.
9.2     Future Work
Potential directions include:
     • More explicit forms of Heff that incorporate retrocausal integrals over |ψ(t′ )⟩ for t′ > t.
     • Numerical simulations on toy models (e.g., low-dimensional Hilbert spaces) with closed loops.
     • Investigating how entanglement among different times might arise in this framework.
10      Conclusion
We have provided a mathematically rigorous framework for a self-steered, retrocausal cognitive process modeled
in Hilbert space. By unifying ideas of quantum scars, chaotic amplification, and distributed cross-temporal mea-
surement, we propose that the mind could close a loop in its own timeline, effectively rewriting subtle aspects of
its perceived history and guiding future states via feedback in Heff .
    This work opens the door to further study of how nonlocal or retrocausal phenomena might be formalized using
a combination of quantum-inspired state-spaces, classical chaotic dynamics, and novel boundary conditions.
