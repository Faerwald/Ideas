Relativity of Simultaneity from Intergalactic to Cranial Scales:
     A Detailed Quantitative Re-examination of the Penrose–Andromeda

                                                         Abstract
          The Penrose–Andromeda paradox vividly demonstrates that even pedestrian relative velocities can gen-
      erate macroscopic simultaneity shifts when the spatial baseline D is large. A mere v = 1 m/s difference
      already displaces “now” in the Andromeda Galaxy (D = 2.54 Mly ≃ 1022 m) by ∆t ≈ 3 d. This paper re-
      formulates the effect with full Lorentz–transform rigor, retaining dimensional fidelity and eschewing hidden
      approximations, and then quantifies the phenomenon across three vastly separated regimes:
        1. Intergalactic baseline (D = 2.54 Mly). Re-derivation of the classic result confirms the small-velocity
           formula ∆t = vD/c2 , tabulating offsets for realistic and speculative v and highlighting the days-scale
           shear obtainable at walking speeds.
        2. Cranial baseline (D = 0.20 m). Even at extreme v ≤ 0.99c the simultaneity offset is < 1 ns, or-
           ders of magnitude below neuronal and CMOS latencies; therefore special-relativistic timing effects are
           irrelevant to intra-brain or chip-scale synchronisation.
                                                    29
        3. Multiverse-scale baseline (D = 1010 ly), introduced via the Vilenkin–Everett equivalence prin-
           ciple. Inserting Max Tegmark’s Level-I multiverse separation into the same formula amplifies ∆t to
                  29                                                                  29
           O(1010 ) yr, exceeding the age of the observable universe by more than 1010 −9 orders of magnitude
           and annihilating every finite dynamical timescale in physics.
          Together these regimes span the entire practical spectrum: ∆t ∼days (intergalactic), sub-nanoseconds
      (cranial), and effectively infinite (multiverse). The analysis underscores two lessons: (i) the linear vD/c2
      scaling is conceptually striking only when D ≳ intergalactic; (ii) no causal mechanism exists to harness
      multiverse-level baselines, as the frames lack a shared horizon. Hence, while simultaneity shifts can be
      mathematically magnified without bound, they remain technologically impotent across every domain relevant
      to biology, computation, or cosmology.

1     Physical and Historical Context
In The Emperor’s New Mind (1989), Penrose asked readers to imagine two pedestrians, A and B, walking
past one another on Earth while discussing events in the Andromeda Galaxy. Because simultaneity is frame-
dependent, the distant plane of simultaneity for A differs from that for B by an amount
                                                               vD
                                                  ∆tsim =         ,
                                                               c2
where v is their relative speed, D the proper distance to Andromeda (≈ 2.40e22 m), and c the invariant speed
of light. The unexpectedly large ∆tsim (several days for v ∼ 1 m/s) is often portrayed as “paradoxical” even
though it is a direct and unproblematic consequence of Lorentz transformations.
2     Lorentz-Transformation Derivation
Let the events be labelled in inertial frame S (observer A) by coordinate 4-vectors (ct, x, y, z). Observer B
moves with velocity +v x̂ relative to A and adopts frame S ′ . With the standard configuration, the Lorentz
matrix is                                                        
                                                   γ    −βγ 0 0
                                               −βγ      γ     0 0
                                        Λµ ν = 
                                                0
                                                                  ,
                                                         0     1 0
                                                   0     0     0 1
where β = v/c and γ = (1 − β 2 )−1/2 .
    Setting ∆t = 0 at the pedestrian encounter and letting ∆x = D for the distant Andromeda event, the
transformed temporal separation is
                                                      D β≪1      vD
                                        ∆t′ = −γ β        −→ − 2 ,                                 (1)

yielding the quoted shift. Signs depend on velocity direction; magnitudes are used below.

                                ∆tsim ≈                      ≈ 2.7e5 s ≈ 3.1 days.

Interpretation. Velocity within normal human capability (1–100 m/s) demands baselines of 107 –109 ly to
achieve multi-year simultaneity discrepancies, showing how crucial cosmic scale is to Penrose’s rhetorical punch.

4.3   Comparison to processor timescales
    • CMOS today: gate delays ∼ 10–100 ps. Even 0.1 c motion barely matches a single gate delay across the
      head; engineering such motion is absurdly harder than pipelining or clock-tree design.
    • Photonic/SW logic (10–100 THz): intrinsic cycles ≤ 0.1 fs. Equation (3) would need v > c to reach
      a one-cycle shift across 20 cm; impossible.
    • Ultimate physical limits (Landauer, reversible ballistic): nothing circumvents the c−2 suppres-
      sion. Baselines must scale commensurately if useful simultaneity manipulation is desired.
5     Broader Implications
Cosmic leverage. Because c2 appears in the denominator, only astronomical baselines convert everyday
speeds into human-intuitive temporal deltas.
Local irrelevance. At instrument or biological scales, simultaneity offsets reside deep below picoseconds.
Electronic design routinely compensates for nanosecond and sub-nanosecond skew via classical methods; in-
voking special relativity gains nothing.
Thought experiments vs. engineering reality. Penrose’s scenario is pedagogically powerful but not
technologically actionable for neuromorphic or classical computing, even on century-scale horizons. One would
either (i) enlarge the device to cosmic scales or (ii) attain forbidden superluminal speeds—rendering the
enterprise moot.

6       Conclusions
    1. For Andromeda’s ∼ 2.5 Mly distance, a pedestrian 1 m/s shift in velocity yields a ∼three-day disagreement
       on “now” in the galaxy—the canonical Penrose result.
    2. Achieving a five-year simultaneity gap at manageable v ≤ 100 m/s demands baselines of at least O(107 ) light-
       years.
    3. Across 0.20 m, even 0.99 c motion fails to exceed 1 ns of temporal shear, vastly below both biological and
       modern-hardware latency budgets.
    4. Consequently, relativity of simultaneity, while conceptually striking, provides no practical timing lever
       for head-sized or chip-scale processors now or in any foreseen technological epoch.
7       Multiverse–Scale Baseline via the Vilenkin–Everett Equivalence
Penrose’s original scenario leveraged an intergalactic baseline (2.5 Mly) to make the relativity of simultaneity
cognitively palpable. An even more extreme “lever arm” emerges once one adopts the Vilenkin–Everett
equivalence principle:1
        A quantum branch that differs only by a microscopic decision (left vs. right) can be mapped, from
                                                                                              29
        an information-theoretic standpoint, onto another Hubble domain located DTeg ∼ 10 10 ly away.
Substituting this distance into the non-relativistic simultaneity formula (1) yields
                                                    v DTeg             1029 −1
                                                                                v 

or, in Julian years,                                                            v 

                                        ∆tmultiverse ≈ 3.33 × 10 10                  yr.                                     (5)
                                                                                m/s
                                                                                                                    29
Numeric extremity. Even a cortical conduction speed of v = 1 m/s gives ∆tmultiverse ≈ 3 × 10 10 −8 years,
                                                                              29
exceeding the age of the observable universe (≈ 1.38 × 1010 yr) by over 10 10 −18 orders of magnitude. Any
reasonable biological or electronic speed (100 –107 m/s) merely shifts the exponent by at most seven, leaving
the figure effectively unchanged.
Consequences.
    1. The simultaneity offset becomes so vast that it eclipses every finite dynamical or cosmological timescale,
       rendering ∆tmultiverse practically unbounded for all engineering purposes.
    2. Exploiting such an offset would require a causal link across disconnected Hubble volumes, violating rela-
       tivistic locality and standard quantum postulates. Thus the result, while mathematically straightforward,
       is physically not actionable.
    3. Conceptually, the calculation dramatizes how the c−2 -suppression in (1) can be overwhelmed by an
       astronomically large baseline, but only in a regime where the notion of inertial coordination itself loses
       operational meaning.
                                                           29
Take-away. By inserting Tegmark’s DTeg = 10 10 ly into the Penrose formula we obliterate the picosecond–
nanosecond ceiling encountered at human or galactic scales: the simultaneity shear now lies beyond any
finite interval that could ever matter to biology, computing, or cosmology. While the exercise is illuminating
as an extrapolation, it also underscores the strict locality of special relativity: timing advantages cannot be
mined from spacetimes that share no causal horizon.
