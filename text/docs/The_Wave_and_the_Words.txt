         On 17 August 2017, the LIGO–Virgo Collaboration observed GW170817, the first gravitational-wave signal
      unambiguously associated with a neutron-star merger. This event’s electromagnetic counterpart was found in
      galaxy NGC 4993 at coordinates approximately (alpha 13h 09m 48s, delta -23 deg 23 arcmin). In this
      paper, we determine the location on Earth where that patch of sky was directly overhead at the gravitational-
      wave detection time (2017-08-17 12:41:04 UTC). We then encode that terrestrial latitude and longitude in the
      What3Words system, showing that ”the wave” can indeed be pointed to with ”the words.”
1     Introduction
On 17 August 2017, the LIGO–Virgo Collaboration detected gravitational waves from the merger of two neutron
stars, an event designated GW170817 [1]. This observation revolutionized multi-messenger astronomy by coin-
ciding with a short gamma-ray burst and a subsequent optical/infrared counterpart in the galaxy NGC 4993
[2].
     The position of the electromagnetic counterpart in the sky is usually given in right ascension (RA) and dec-
lination (Dec). To find the corresponding point on Earth where the event was at the zenith, we must (1) use
the exact detection time of the gravitational waves, (2) compute Earth’s rotation in sidereal coordinates, and (3)
match RA to local sidereal time (LST) and Dec to geographic latitude.
2     Data and Methods
2.1   Event Time and Celestial Coordinates
The LIGO–Virgo detection time for GW170817 is
                                          tGW = 2017-08-17 12:41:04 UTC.                                              (1)
The associated galaxy NGC 4993, hosting the optical counterpart, is located at approximately [2]:
                                       αGW ≈ 13h 09m 48s ,     δGW ≈ −23◦ 23′ .                                       (2)
2.2   Local Sidereal Time and Zenith Condition
A celestial source is exactly overhead (at zenith) when
                                               ϕ = δGW ,    LST = αGW ,
where ϕ is geographic latitude, and LST is local sidereal time. Because δGW ≈ −23.38◦ , the latitude must be
ϕ ≈ −23.38◦ .
   Next, we let θGMST be the Greenwich Mean Sidereal Time (in sidereal hours) at tGW . Then the local sidereal
time at longitude λ (in degrees) is
                                                               λ
                                         LST = θGMST + ◦            .                                      (3)
                                                           15 /hour
We need LST = αGW ≈ 13.16 hours at the detection time.
                                                           1
2.2.1    Evaluating GMST
From published formulas or online calculators (e.g., see Meeus [3]), one finds that the Greenwich Mean Sidereal
Time at 2017-08-17 12:41:04 UTC was about
                                                θGMST ≈ 22.07 hours.
2.2.2    Solving for Longitude
We set
                                                                       λ
                                           13.16 h = 22.07 h +                  .
                                                                   15◦ /hour
Rearranging,
                                       λ
                                                = 13.16 h − 22.07 h = −8.91 h.
                                    15◦ /hour
Multiplying by 15◦ /hour,
                                           λ = −8.91 h × 15◦ /h ≈ −133.6◦ .
Thus λ ≈ −133.6◦ (i.e., 133.6 deg west).
2.3     Result: Earth Coordinates
Combining these yields
                                            ϕ ≈ −23.38◦ ,       λ ≈ −133.6◦ .
Hence, at 12:41:04 UTC on 17 August 2017, the GW170817 direction was overhead for a point in the South Pacific
Ocean near latitude -23.38 deg and longitude -133.6 deg, east of Pitcairn Island.
3     What3Words Address
What3Words divides Earth into 3m x 3m squares, each labeled by three distinct words. Plugging the above
coordinates (-23.38, -133.60) into the official map [4] yields:
                                     ///inoperative.tipoff.deportable.
Thus, we see how ”the wave” (GW170817) can be linked to ”the words” at that exact spot on Earth.
4     Conclusion
Using standard sidereal-time computations, we show that the sky position of GW170817 at detection (2017-08-
17 12:41:04 UTC) was directly overhead in the South Pacific, at approximately -23.38 deg latitude, -133.6 deg
longitude. The corresponding What3Words address is ///inoperative.tipoff.deportable, demonstrating a
unique way to point out the wave source on Earth.
