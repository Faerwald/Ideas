Conversations Across Time: AI Supercomputers, the
 Southern Ocean, and the Fate of Global Climate
Prologue (A Single Mind in Two Eras)
It is said that knowledge can transcend time. Imagine one person having a dialogue with their future
self: both the curious student and the more experienced mentor occupy the same mind, separated
by decades of discoveries, triumphs, and regrets. Here is their conversation, woven into a scientific
narrative.
Student (Year 2025): I have this intriguing idea, or perhaps a worrying notion: What if we tried
to cool our massive supercomputers by sinking them into the Southern Ocean, exploiting its naturally
cold waters? Would that added heat ruin the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, upset global climate,
and melt Antarctic ice sheets? Is such a thing even feasible?
Mentor (Year 2050): The question is more than feasible; it is downright alarming. Let me explain
in detail. The Southern Ocean, with a volume of about
                                         VSo = 7.8 × 1016 m3 ,
acts as a keystone for global climate and ocean circulation. Its water mass is cold and dense, driving
deep ocean currents such as the formation of Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW). The Antarctic Cir-
cumpolar Current (ACC) is the most powerful ocean current on Earth, linking the Atlantic, Pacific,
and Indian Oceans. Small perturbations in its temperature and salinity can have huge consequences
for Earth’s climate.
Student: But how much heat are we talking about? Could something as mundane as computer
cooling really warm up such a massive body of water?
Mentor: Let’s do some back-of-the-envelope calculations to see whether this effect, if scaled up
massively, could become non-negligible. Assume:
                 3
 ρsw ≈ 1027 kg/m                                                   (density of seawater),
 cp ≈ 3993 J kg−1 K−1                                              (specific heat of seawater),
 Eper FLOP ≈ 3 × 10−11 J/FLOP                                      (energy consumption per FLOP),
 Current global computational power ≈ 1 × 1018 FLOPS,
 Projected 2050 comp. power ≈ 1 × 1021 FLOPS,
 Fraction of total comp. placed in the ocean ≈ 30% = 0.3,
 ηheat ≈ 0.9 (fraction of CPU energy that becomes waste heat).
   Let Pcurrent be the total power used by the current global computation, and Pfuture be the projected
                                                  1
total power by 2050. Then:
                                                              J
                Pcurrent = 1 × 1018 FLOPS × 3 × 10−11            = 3 × 107 J/s = 30 MJ/s.
                                                            FLOP
                                                      J
                Pfuture = 1 × 1021 FLOPS × 3 × 10−11      = 3 × 1010 J/s = 30 GJ/s.
                                                    FLOP
If 30% of this computation is done under the Southern Ocean, and about 90% of that power leaves as
heat dissipated directly into the water, we have:
                         Pocean, current = 0.3 × 0.9 × 3 × 107 J/s = 8.1 × 106 J/s,
                         Pocean, future = 0.3 × 0.9 × 3 × 1010 J/s = 8.1 × 109 J/s.
   Now, the total mass of the Southern Ocean is:
                                                                     3
                    mSo = VSo × ρsw = 7.8 × 1016 m3 × 1027 kg/m ≈ 8.0 × 1019 kg.
The temperature rise rate Ṫ is given by
                                                        Pocean
                                                 Ṫ =          .
                                                        mSo cp
Using current-scale Pocean, current = 8.1 × 106 J/s,
                                            8.1 × 106 J/s
                      Ṫcurrent   =                             ≈ 2.53 × 10−17 K/s.
                                    (8.0 × 10 kg) (3993 J/kg K)
                                             19
Over one year (≈ 3.15 × 107 s),
                    ∆Tcurrent ≈ 2.53 × 10−17 K/s × 3.15 × 107 s ≈ 8 × 10−10 K/year.
Barely a nanokelvin per year! Clearly negligible on short timescales for the current scenario.
   But by mid-century (projected Pocean, future = 8.1 × 109 J/s),
                                            8.1 × 109 J/s
                       Ṫfuture   =                             ≈ 2.53 × 10−14 K/s,
                                    (8.0 × 10 kg) (3993 J/kg K)
                                             19
                  ∆Tfuture per year ≈ 2.53 × 10−14 K/s × 3.15 × 107 s ≈ 8 × 10−7 K/year.
In a century, that might reach the order of 10−4 K. Still tiny. Yet the real worry is not just the bulk
ocean temperature rise: it’s also where the heat is introduced and how it modifies density gradients
critical to deep-water formation and circulation.
Student: So the big picture is that even slight, localized changes could weaken or shift major ocean
currents. Are there threshold effects?
Mentor: Precisely. Even a small fraction of a degree, if injected at the right depth and region,
can hamper AABW formation. The ACC’s strength is roughly tied to density contrasts in the polar
regions. We represent it via the approximate geostrophic balance. If ∆ρ between cold bottom waters
                                                        2
and warmer surface/intermediate waters shrinks enough, the sinking slows or stops altogether.
   We can formalize the threshold condition for collapse of the Southern Ocean’s deep circulation by
considering the equation of state for seawater. A simplified linear approach says:
                                      ∆ρ = − ρ α ∆T + ρ β ∆S,
where ρ is baseline density, α is the thermal expansion coefficient (≈ 2 × 10−4 K−1 ), β is the haline
contraction coefficient (≈ 8 × 10−4 PSU−1 ), ∆T is the warming, and ∆S is the change in salinity.
    One finds that if a region crucial to bottom-water formation warms by about 0.8 K in situ (without
compensating salinity increases), the density contrast to the overlying layers can vanish, halting over-
turning in that region. The broad story from paleoclimatic data: once such overturning shuts down,
it can remain off for millennia.
Student: Could we offset this by directly increasing salinity in that region? If the salinity rises, it
offsets the buoyancy caused by heat. That’s an outlandish idea—adding salt to the ocean—but is it
theoretically possible?
Mentor: Theoretically, yes. Practically, it’s extremely challenging. Suppose we want to increase
salinity by ∆S to compensate for ∆T = 0.5 K of additional warming. Then
                                                    α
                                             ∆S =     ∆T.
                                                    β
With α = 2 × 10−4 K−1 , β = 8 × 10−4 PSU−1 ,
                                        2 × 10−4
                                 ∆S =            × 0.5 = 0.125 PSU.
                                        8 × 10−4
To increase the salinity of the Southern Ocean (volume 7.8 × 1016 m3 ) by 0.125 PSU, you might need
on the order of 1016 kg of salt. That is colossal. For perspective, it’s trillions of tons—beyond any
realistic engineering project in the near future. On top of that, glacial meltwater from Antarctica
actively lowers salinity, counteracting such efforts.
    Nevertheless, people have hypothesized futuristic geoengineering solutions: encouraging extra sea
ice formation so that brine rejection (salt leftover when water freezes) increases local salinity. But
it’s all extremely risky, and the ocean’s global connectivity means tinkering in Antarctica might cause
unexpected havoc for monsoons or upwelling thousands of kilometers away.
Student: So once the ACC and AABW formation weaken beyond a certain point, it doesn’t just
bounce back?
Mentor: Precisely. The thermohaline circulation can assume multiple stable states. Once it flips, it
often stays flipped for a very long time. If the Southern Ocean stops pumping cold, oxygen-rich water
into the deep ocean, you get:
        (1) Stagnation   −→     (2) Oxygen depletion     −→     (3) Marine ecosystem collapse.
                                                    3
   And on the climate side, less CO2 absorption by cold waters means more greenhouse effect, acceler-
ating planetary warming. Also, warmer Southern Ocean water melts Antarctic ice faster, compounding
sea level rise.
Student: This is horrifying. And to think it could all start from us trying to cool supercomputers in
the ocean?
Mentor: That’s the dramatic version. Our back-of-the-envelope showed that global warming from
the computational waste heat alone is likely to be minuscule in the near future. But local hotspots or
localized density changes could trigger tipping points if supercomputing expansions are poorly planned
or if other climate stressors coincide. The real nightmare is synergy with other forms of warming and
meltwater pulses. A small nudge might push the system over the edge.
A Glimpse of Fluid Dynamics: Slowing ACC
The ACC speed U (often around 0.4 m/s in key regions) can be sensitive to density stratification. If
we denote a baseline density by ρ0 and a small density increase or decrease by ∆ρ, we might write the
geostrophic scaling:
                                                  g ∆ρ
                                            U∼         D,
                                                  f ρ0
where g is gravitational acceleration, f is the Coriolis parameter, and D is a relevant vertical length
scale. Even a small fractional change in ∆ρ/ρ0 can reduce U significantly. Replacing ∆ρ with
−ρ0 α ∆T , we see the direct effect of temperature changes. The ocean’s response is complicated, but
the moral is consistent: keep the Southern Ocean near its historical density regime, or risk meltdown
of its deep circulation.
Student: Suppose all the worst happens, and we break the ocean “engine.” Are we done for? Does
the planet come back?
Mentor: Geological history suggests that once thermohaline circulation shuts down, restoration hap-
pens over millennia to tens of millennia—far beyond typical human civilization timescales. The Earth
has self-correcting processes, but they’re slow. Our farmland, coastal cities, and the entire modern
infrastructure? They’d likely be abandoned in the face of severe climate shifts, massive sea-level rise,
and resource wars. The civilization that emerges in the aftermath might be unrecognizable.
An Imagined Future Scenario
(A few centuries from now.)
    Historian: We read in old archives that in the early 21st century, people considered submerging
giant data centers in the Southern Ocean to solve some of their cooling problems. Combined with other
warming factors, that choice—though only one small piece of the puzzle—helped push the polar ocean
beyond a fateful threshold. The ACC slowed by 30% in half a century, leading to decreased oxygenation
of the deep ocean and accelerated meltdown of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. Over centuries, sea levels
                                                   4
rose several meters, and the ocean acidified as carbon accumulation soared.
   It took the world thousands of years to reestablish a stable ocean circulation pattern. By then,
the coastlines had changed dramatically, new deserts had formed, and the anthropogenic imprint was
etched into the fossil record. Some call it the Great Anthropocene Disruption.
Mentor (Concluding Advice): So, my dear time-split self, be cautious. Keep supercomputers out
of critical ocean zones. Let us not nudge the one oceanic engine that we rely on for stable climate.
Invest in more efficient compute methods, better heat recycling, or safe onshore cooling technologies.
Because once the polar oceanic thresholds are crossed, we do not get a reset button.

1. Temperature Rise in the Southern Ocean.
                                                      Pocean
                                               Ṫ =          ,
                                                      mSo cp
                                                                                     
             mSo = VSo ρsw ,   Pocean = ηheat × Fraction × Total Power from FLOPs .
2. Density Contrast (Linearized Equation of State).
                                        ∆ρ = − ρ α ∆T + ρ β ∆S,
where α ≈ 2 × 10−4 K−1 (thermal expansion), β ≈ 8 × 10−4 PSU−1 (saline contraction).
3. Salinity Adjustment for Warming Compensation.
                                                       α
                                               ∆S =      ∆T.
                                                       β
For a 0.5 K warming, ∆S ≈ 0.125 PSU.
4. Scale of Salt Addition Required.
Raising the salinity of the Southern Ocean by ∆S requires mass of salt
                                   Msalt ≈ ∆S × mSo = ∆S × VSo ρsw ,
which can be on the order of 1016 kg, i.e. trillions of tons.
In the end, whether the Southern Ocean’s threshold is crossed or not depends on our collective choices:
how we power and cool our machines, how we manage greenhouse gas emissions, and whether we
attempt large-scale geoengineering with uncertain consequences. Perhaps we can steer away from the
worst outcome by heeding the warnings from a conversation across time.
