 Matthew!!
 the screenshots are good. the code works for single isotopes and with noise. BUT! unless
 you get the parameters set right at the start, the program won't say "found em!" - so to
 speak.
 i made it very "auto-magical"
 you click three buttons: "suggest parameters", "generate data", and "analyze"... oh wait..
 and you gotta check which isotopes you want at the bottom, and click the box for noise
 versus no noise..
 ... but .. it's limited to identifying things cuz it's knowledge is a just handful os isotopes (five
 in the code)... ...
 the code it below if you wanna play with it :)
 still improving it. and the paper is garbage. (i'll write up something after i get it to work for
 more isotopes.)
 just sharing.
 Take Care Matthew!

 Awesome, thanks! This is great progress!!
 (But when there is no noise.. why is the peak at 0.0 instead of the current mean life time?)

 Yes! that's my mom :)
 i wrote but forgot to send earlier, im working on awesome software :D
 also, now im setting up "codex" (openai github)
 sorry bout this late reply, i wanted to have the software complete.
 it's taking a while cuz im working on stuff in parallel... (i know i know...) but i want to be able
 to make best use of the 3 hours, so i need everything ready
 i want to have my best ideas typed and with notes for the time we'll have, AND have "all my
 other crazy ideas" typed, And... ... ... ...
 i think with your enthusiasm, .. if i can plan out who to connect with for each idea, and have
 them all in writing,... ... ........
 i want to make it all real. and i know i can't do it alone. so i need to be right, i need it
 communicated well, and i need to talk to the right people, ....
 i'm working to get everything in order. the software is the key. the key to unlocking the deal
 for 3 hours that is.
 so... that's my update. im working on the software and the ideas i want ready to present.
 and coming up with a plan for the months afterward to get them all in motion.
 you're algorithm is part of something much bigger - a machine that can solve the
 millenium problems in minutes. i will explain better later. it will work.
