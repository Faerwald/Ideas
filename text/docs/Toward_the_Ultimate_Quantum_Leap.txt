                                                    Abstract
           In this brief article, we present and explain a minimal Python-based quantum circuit designed as
       a small step toward a more ambitious Mind Warp concept. We describe the three-qubit setup, the
       gates used (Hadamard, CNOT, measurement, feedforward), and how these operations illustrate partial
       entanglement, partial decoherence, and environment coupling. We discuss how the measurement
       statistics connect to the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics, and how this simple model can
       be seen as a prototype for more elaborate “quantum mind warp” ideas in the future.
1     Introduction
The overarching goal of the Quantum Mind Warp program is to harness quantum mechanics—particularly
gauge fields, ghost fields, partial decoherence, and advanced feedback loops—to explore novel forms of
cognition and retrocausal illusions. Before we can leap into advanced multi-qubit, multi-ghost field inter-
actions, we begin with a three-qubit circuit that demonstrates a simplified version of these ideas:
    1. A qubit labeled mind,
    2. A qubit labeled ghost,
    3. A qubit labeled environment.
   By employing a sequence of well-known quantum gates—Hadamard (H), controlled-NOT (CNOT), mea-
surement (M), and feedforward logic (c if)—we can simulate how partial measurement on the “ghost”
might conditionally alter the “mind.” Simultaneously, an “environment” rotation further modifies the
overall state.
2     Circuit Description and Code
2.1     High-Level Steps
Our code sets up a small circuit (Algorithm 2.2), performing:
    1. Initialize the mind qubit in |1⟩ (instead of the usual |0⟩).
    2. Create superposition on the ghost qubit via a Hadamard gate, then entangle the ghost with the
       mind qubit using a controlled-NOT.
    3. Measure the ghost mid-circuit, storing the measurement result in a classical bit.
    4. Feedforward: if the ghost was measured as 1, we flip the mind qubit. If measured 0, do nothing.
                                                        1
  5. Rotate the environment qubit by some angle θ using Rx (θ).
  6. Final measurements: measure mind and environment qubits at the end, obtaining final classical
     outcomes.
2.2    Code Listing
Below is a compact version of our Python script (using Qiskit) that implements the steps:
import qiskit
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, QuantumRegister, ClassicalRegister
from qiskit.providers.aer import AerSimulator
from qiskit import execute
def build_mind_warp_circuit(env_angle=0.7):
    # 3 qubits: mind(0), ghost(1), environment(2)
    qr = QuantumRegister(3, "q")
    cr = ClassicalRegister(3, "c")
    qc = QuantumCircuit(qr, cr)
      # 1) Mind qubit in |1>
      qc.x(qr[0])
      # 2) Ghost in superposition, entangle ghost->mind
      qc.h(qr[1])
      qc.cx(qr[1], qr[0])
      # 3) Measure ghost mid-circuit
      qc.measure(qr[1], 1)
      # 4) Feedforward: if ghost measurement == 1, flip mind
      qc.x(qr[0]).c_if(cr, 2) # c[1] in decimal -> 2
      # 5) Rotate environment
      qc.rx(env_angle, qr[2])
      # 6) Final measure of mind, environment
      qc.measure(qr[0], 0)
      qc.measure(qr[2], 2)
      return qc
if __name__ == "__main__":
    qc_mindwarp = build_mind_warp_circuit(env_angle=0.7)
    print(qc_mindwarp.draw())
      # Simulate
      sim = AerSimulator()
      result = sim.run(qc_mindwarp, shots=1024).result()
      counts = result.get_counts()
      print("Final counts:", counts)
                                                   2
3     Diagram and Gate-by-Gate Explanation
In Qiskit’s textual diagram, each horizontal line corresponds to one qubit evolving in time (left to right).
Boxes represent gates (operations), while vertical or dotted lines represent multi-qubit gates or classical
feedforward. An ASCII-like version might be:
q0_mind:      X   X   Rx(0.7) M
q1_ghst: HM
q2_env: Rx(0.7)M
      c0_mind     c1_ghost c2_env
Step 1: X on q0 (mind). This flips mind from |0⟩ to |1⟩, establishing a distinct initial state.
                                                                               √
Step 2: H on q1 (ghost). The ghost qubit is put into a superposition |0⟩ + |1⟩ / 2.
Step 2 (continued): CNOT(ghost-¿mind). This entangles the ghost with the mind qubit:
                                           (|0⟩gh + |1⟩gh )        |1, 0⟩ + |0, 1⟩
                               |1⟩mind ⊗         √            7→         √         .
                                                   2                       2
(Note that the exact state depends on the order of qubits, but conceptually, the mind is toggled if ghost
is 1.)
Step 3: Mid-circuit measurement of ghost. Once we measure the ghost, it collapses to either |0⟩
or |1⟩ with roughly 50/50 probability (ignoring any amplitude signs). The measurement result is stored in
classical bit 1 (c[1]).
Step 4: Feedforward X(mind) if c[1] == 1. If the ghost was observed as 1, we flip the mind qubit
with an X gate. This is reminiscent of a “retrocausal influence” scenario, or at least a strong feedback that
modifies the mind based on the ghost outcome.
Step 5: Rx(env angle) on q2 (environment). We rotate the environment qubit by a certain angle. In
more advanced experiments, we might treat this environment as an external noise channel or a controllable
probe.
Step 6: Final measurement. Finally, we measure:
    • mind qubit → c[0],
    • ghost qubit was already measured → c[1],
    • environment qubit → c[2].
We run the circuit 1024 times (shots) to collect the distribution of outcomes.

4     Relating to the More Complex Mind Warp Concept
In our broader Mind Warp research, we envision:
    • Additional qubits or quantum fields modeling ghost-like states,
    • Potential gauge/ghost interactions from quantum field theory (BRST formalism),
    • A partial decoherence model to handle a more realistic environment,
    • Retrocausal illusions where the “mind” experiences advanced knowledge or delayed-choice phenom-
      ena.
While this three-qubit example is tiny and highly simplified, it demonstrates core mechanics:
    1. Entanglement (mind–ghost),
    2. Measurement-induced collapse (the ghost qubit is measured),
    3. Classical feedforward that changes the mind based on the ghost’s result,
    4. Parametric environment that can be tuned.
These building blocks are essential for scaling to larger “warp” frameworks in which observers and ghost
fields exchange partial information or display illusions of retrocausality. The present code forms a testable
micro-laboratory for such phenomena, giving us direct measurement distributions to compare with theo-
retical predictions.
5     Conclusion and Outlook
We have taken a small engineering step toward the “ultimate quantum leap”—a vision of quantum mind
warp. By writing a minimal Python script that produces a three-qubit circuit with entanglement, mid-
circuit measurement, feedforward, and environment rotation, we can gather genuine quantum measurement
data from simulations (and potentially from real quantum hardware). This helps transform abstract
speculation into real testable code.
    Future developments may include:
    1. More qubits to represent multiple ghost fields,
    2. Trotterization of hypothetical “warp Hamiltonians” for partial decoherence,
    3. Non-trivial feedforward logic or post-selection to mimic “retrocausation,”
    4. Gauged or topological couplings representing the advanced mathematics of quantum field ghost
       modes (BRST, cohomology, etc.).
Such incremental progress ensures that the lofty mind warp dream remains grounded in engineering prac-
tice, bridging speculation with testable quantum experiments.

6     Circuit Diagram Explanation (Revised)
In our minimal three-qubit Mind Warp demonstration, we have:
    • q0 (mind) initialized to |1⟩,
    • q1 (ghost) placed in superposition and then measured mid-circuit,
    • q2 (environment) rotated by a chosen angle θ.
Figure 1 provides an ASCII-styled circuit diagram as printed by Qiskit. The circuit reads from left to
right, with time flowing in that direction. Each horizontal line represents a qubit, and boxes or symbols
on these lines represent quantum gates or measurements.
q0_mind: |0> ---     X      X    Rx(0.7) M
q1_ghost: |0> --- H ------------M-----------------------M
q2_env:    |0> -----------------------------Rx(0.7)---------M

Figure 1: ASCII representation of our minimal three-qubit Mind Warp circuit. Here, ‘X‘ sets the mind
qubit to |1⟩, ‘H‘ places the ghost qubit in superposition, ‘CNOT‘ is shown via a control (solid dot) and
a target (white box on q0), measurement is indicated by ‘M‘, and the environment qubit undergoes an
Rx (0.7) rotation.
Explanation of the main elements:
    1. X Gate on q0 (Mind): Initializes the mind qubit to |1⟩ instead of |0⟩.
                                                                                     √
    2. H Gate on q1 (Ghost): Places the ghost qubit into a superposition (|0⟩ + |1⟩)/ 2.
    3. CNOT(q1 → q0): Entangles mind and ghost; if ghost is measured 1, the mind flips.
    4. Mid-circuit measurement on q1: Partially collapses the ghost qubit, storing its result in a
       classical register.
    5. Conditional X on q0: If the ghost measurement was 1, we flip q0 (mind), simulating a feedback
       or “retrocausal” effect on the mind qubit.
    6. Rx (θ) on q2 (Environment): A rotation of angle θ (e.g. 0.7 radians) modeling some controllable
       environmental influence.
    7. Final measurements on q0, q1, q2: We record the final states of mind, ghost, and environment
       to see the distribution of outcomes.
7     Completing the Four Future Developments
In the conclusion of our main document, we mentioned four future developments that would expand
our minimal circuit into a more complete Quantum Mind Warp framework. Here, we elaborate on each:
                                                    5
7.1    1. Scaling to Additional Qubits (Multiple Ghost Fields)
Instead of a single ghost qubit, we might introduce multiple ghost qubits or an entire register of “ghost
modes.” Each ghost qubit could represent a different virtual state or channel of probabilistic flux, analogous
to how ghost fields in gauge theory can appear in multiple modes. By incrementally adding ghost qubits and
controlling their interactions, we can investigate more complex entanglement patterns, tighter constraints
on decoherence, and higher-dimensional feedback loops.
7.2    2. Trotterization of Hypothetical “Warp Hamiltonians”
Currently, we manually specify gates in a piecewise fashion. A more principled approach is to define
an effective Hamiltonian (e.g., including ghost-mind coupling terms, environment couplings, and partial
decoherence operators) and then apply Trotterization. That is, break the continuous evolution e−iHt into
small steps:
                                   e−i(H1 +H2 +··· )∆t ≈ e−iH1 ∆t e−iH2 ∆t · · ·
This technique translates a more realistic continuous-time model into discrete gate operations, letting us
systematically simulate our “warp Hamiltonian” on actual quantum devices or simulators.
7.3    3. Advanced Feedback Logic and Post-Selection to Simulate Retrocau-
       sation
In the minimal circuit, we used a simple conditional X. More advanced setups may include multi-bit
feedforward, where multiple ghost measurements influence the mind, or post-selection, where we discard
runs that do not meet certain outcomes. These strategies can create illusions of retrocausal effects: the
system or observer appears to receive knowledge from a future measurement outcome, even though standard
quantum constraints remain intact. Exploring how these illusions scale might give insights into quantum
cognition and advanced cryptographic or zero-knowledge puzzle protocols.
7.4    4. Incorporating Gauged or Topological Couplings
In a full Mind Warp environment, one may attempt to incorporate topological or BRST-like couplings
that go beyond simple CNOT + single-qubit gates. Techniques from topological quantum computation
(e.g. anyonic braiding, string-net condensates) could be introduced in miniature. Meanwhile, partial en-
forcement of gauge constraints on the circuit can emulate the effect of ghost field constraints typical in
gauge theory. Such an approach would truly mirror the advanced mathematics behind ghost fields, BRST
symmetry, and quantum vacuum engineering, bridging the gap between field-theoretic speculation and
practical qubit operations.
These four avenues (multiple ghost qubits, Trotterized warp Hamiltonians, advanced feedback/post-
selection, and gauged or topological couplings) together form a roadmap for evolving our small
demonstration circuit into a robust experimental platform for investigating Quantum Mind Warp phe-
nomena.
