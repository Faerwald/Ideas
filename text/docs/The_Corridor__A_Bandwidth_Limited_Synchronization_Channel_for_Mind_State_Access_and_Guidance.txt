The Corridor: A Bandwidth-Limited Synchronization Channel for
                      Mind-State Access and Guidance
Abstract
The Corridor is not a tunnel into autobiographical storage; it is a narrow, adaptive readout of what the
 brain currently has mounted for use. Its reach is constrained by information theory and observability:
 one can see, and sometimes gently steer, only what is live in working memory, not what lies dormant in
 long-term synapses. When outward expression is throttled to silence and attention is pinned to hard
 external symbols, the Corridor’s mutual information collapses and the remaining influence must ride
 slower, costlier exogenous cues. In the felt phenomenology, this can masquerade as telepathy or even
“travel,” because small, well-timed nudges near decision boundaries flip which narrative wins and later
 consolidation stitches the outcome back across prior scaffolds. The poetry is the feeling; the physics is a
 communication-and-control problem with lawful limits.
1. What the Corridor is: state access, not storage extraction
Let x(t) ∈ Rn denote latent neural state, w(t) = P x(t) the working-memory (WM) projection that
subserves ongoing cognition, and y(t) = h(w(t)) + ν(t) the externally readable stream (speech, micro-
movements, eye traces) contaminated by noise ν. The Corridor couples to w(t): it can read what
is active, not dormant synaptic parameters θ that encode long-term memory. This distinction has
an empirical backbone. Contemporary WM research shows that task-relevant content often resides
in “activity-silent” substrates and can be pinged back into decodability by brief perturbations; the
representation becomes legible when reactivated, not continuously broadcast. In the Corridor frame,
this means that what is seen is the real-time projection w(t) and whatever you co-activate alongside
it; what is not reactivated is, for all practical purposes, invisible. Thus, tactical silence, breath, gaze
fixation, and the deliberate withholding of exemplars are not folk rituals but observability operations:
they reduce the surface of w(t) and cut the readout down to what you choose to mount. Formally, the
Corridor observes w(t) and acts, at most, by modulating priors over trajectories of x(t); the inaccessible
remainder stays locked behind the rank of the local observability matrix.
2. Why it feels like “telepathy”: synchronization under band-
width and selection
The everyday sensation that “they knew what I was thinking” is the lawful result of synchronization
to w(t) under tight capacity. When you are talkative, the stream Y has high entropy and rare, crisp
tokens (“index words,” name-tags, improbable quips) carry many bits; when you become silent, H(Y )
drops toward zero and the Corridor must route influence through eye-guided symbols and salience
on environmental signs. A session therefore oscillates between fast, high-entropy coupling and slow,
exogenous pinning. In both regimes, the Corridor exploits the same weakness: near a cognitive
separatrix—two narratives nearly tied—a tiny, well-timed nudge flips the winner and the world feels as
if it “decided.” Afterward, memory consolidation, dream incorporation, and reconsolidation bind that
decision into your prior scaffolds, lending the retroactive impression that the past updated. Nothing

supernatural is needed; a narrow, lawful channel matched to a plastic, hierarchical memory is sufficient
to generate the uncanny.
3. Capacity, control, and the cost of steering
Two ceilings police the Corridor. The first is the Shannon–Hartley bound I max = B log2 (1 + SNR), a
statement that mutual information cannot exceed the entropy you actually emit and the quality of the
channel that carries it. Silence drives H(Y ) ↓ and with it the Corridor’s usable information; deliberately
improbable utterances spike I but at low duty cycle. The second ceiling is the information cost of
control: in the linearly-solvable control family, reshaping passive dynamics into controlled dynamics pays
a Kullback–Leibler tax D KL(p u∥p 0), so improbable trajectories cost bits/nats. This is why skilled
operators never shove; they wait where the local Lyapunov geometry is kind—on the boundary where
tiny pushes have macroscopic leverage—and let your own actuators carry the large move. The Corridor,
properly understood, selects for null-residue edits because those are the only ones cheap enough under
both capacity and divergence constraints.
4. Observability gating and exogenous pinning
 Corridor influence depends as much on what you withhold as on what you say. A clean switch from
“write-mode” to “read-mode” is achieved by near-silent output plus steady fixation: this collapses output
 entropy, deprives the Corridor of high-rate tokens, and forces any residual steering to piggyback on
 exogenous anchors like printed street signs, labels, and numbers. Those anchors act as externalized
working memory: once you bind w(t) to a physically present, publicly verifiable symbol, the edit cost
 rises because redundancy rises, and hard facts snap ambiguous identity claims back into a single, stable
 assignment. In practice, this is why reading signs in silence de-fuzzes a session and why corrections from
 a third party collapse a drifting narrative immediately and for good.
5. Ultrametric path-dependence and why “near” is cheap
Human memory is not Euclidean space; it is taxonomic, hierarchical, often ultrametric. Within such
a geometry, retrieval is path-dependent: walking inside a branch is cheap, jumping across branches
requires climbing toward a common ancestor and then descending, paying attention and time. The
Corridor rides whatever branch you surface. If you keep only the category label active (a high-level node)
and refuse to mount a specific exemplar (a leaf), you reveal a family but deny a handle. Conversely, if
you mount a leaf with very low prior under your own habits—a quirky compliment, a tag on a shoe—you
momentarily open a high-gain, high-surprisal index that both ends can lock onto, leaving an audit
handle without handing over a map.
6. Travel without moving: time-symmetric metaphors for
selection
The repeated subjective impression of “walking backward” or “editing after the fact” admits a crisp,
non-mystical gloss. Conditioning a trajectory on a terminal boundary is a time-symmetric operation
in the mathematics, even if the underlying mechanisms are implemented forward in time. In physics,
advanced/retarded decompositions are a respectable way to describe time-symmetric influence without
violating causality; in cognition, the practical analogue is post-selection: keep only the low-residue
branch in which redundant traces of the intervention are absent, then let sleep and reconsolidation do
the stitching that projects the choice back across the lattice of prior fragments. The felt “travel” is the
mind’s honest inference about a worldline that has been conditioned.

                Silence reduces H(Y ) and collapses Corridor capacity; influence must route
                through exogenous pinning, raising edit cost and enforcing hard constraints.
7. Minimal mechanics and signatures
A useful local surrogate is
                         ẋ = f (x, θ) + B u + ξ,      w = P x,         y = h(w) + ν,
with θ encoding synaptic long-term memory. The Corridor observes w and at most modulates priors on
x near separatrices. Observable signatures then fall out: a brief “erase window” with unusually clean
continuity but missing micro-detail; an improbably crisp utterance that functions as a low-prior index;
a subsequent period where sleep-dependent writeback fills older, related dream fragments; and sharp
collapses when a printed symbol or a third-party correction imposes a hard constraint. None of these
are optional ornaments; they are simply what a narrow channel coupled to a plastic hierarchical memory
must look like from the inside.
8. Hygiene and right use
Because the Corridor is law-bound, small disciplines pay. Anchor first; speak rarely and with precision
when you must, then return to silence; mount categories when you wish to show a forest but not a tree;
refuse to rehearse what you intend to hide; recruit hard, external symbols when you require a snap to
fact. These are not superstitions but invariants of observability and control: make the visible subspace
smaller, reduce the channel entropy, shift the geometry toward places where only truth can stand, and
selection will be forced to keep the clean branch.
