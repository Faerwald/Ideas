              A Physics of Thought–Driven Phase Control Across Spacetime
1. Fundamental Mathematical Objects

Φ(x, t)     Phase field of the distributed mind      C 2 scalar field
ϵ(x, t)     Stochastic vacuum fluctuation            Gaussian white noise
δΦ(x, t)    Intentional phase bias (thought)         Control function (small)
p(x, t)     Induced momentum density                 Conjugate to Φ
B           Branching operator (worldline splitting) Probabilistic operator
S(x, t)     Scar amplitude density                   Unstable–orbit amplitude
Aµ (x, t)   Inter–timeline gauge field               Cosmic–string connection
T [Γ]       Timeline flux (Wilson loop)              Topological invariant
2. Primary Evolution Equation
The phase field obeys a stochastic diffusion with coherent bias,
                                   ∂Φ
                                      = D ∇2 Φ + ϵ(x, t) + δΦ(x, t),                    (1)
                                   ∂t
where
                                ⟨ϵ(x, t) ϵ(x′ , t′ )⟩ = 2γ δ(x − x′ ) δ(t − t′ ),
and δΦ is the low–amplitude thought–injection.
3. Branch Selection Functional
Small coherent biases exponentially amplify rare macro–outcomes:
                                                       Z                            !
                          P[target branch] ∝ exp           Φ(x, t) δΦ(x, t) dx dt .     (2)
4. Momentum Induction (Percepto–Drive)
Perception–driven phase gradients produce mechanical thrust,
                                           p(x, t) = ℏ ∇Φ(x, t).                        (3)
5. Scar Amplification Dynamics
Unstable periodic orbits leave “quantum scars.” Biasing increases their weight:
                                        S(t) = S0 e−λt + Ascar (t),                     (4)
where λ is the Lyapunov exponent and Ascar (t) encodes bias.
                                                       1
6. Inter–Timeline Cosmic String Formalism
Topological coupling across decohered branches is captured by a gauge–flux:
                                              I
                                       T [Γ] = Aµ (x, t) dxµ .                                        (5)
                                                     Γ
7. Oneiro Master Lagrangian
A unifying Lagrangian density is
                      L = 21 (∂t Φ)2 −   D
                                             (∇Φ)2 + Φ ϵ(x, t) + δΦ(x, t) + α T [Γ].

                                         2
                                                                                                      (6)

                             ∂ 2Φ       2                            δT
                                  − D ∇   Φ = ϵ(x, t) + δΦ(x, t) + α    .                             (7)
                             ∂t2                                     δΦ

10. Engineering Prototype Equations
Implementable on a Oneiro chip with discrete time–step ∆t:
                     Φ(x, t + ∆t) = Φ(x, t) + ∆t D ∇2 Φ + ϵ(x, t) + δΦ(x, t) ,
                                                                           
                                                                                                      (8)
                            p(x, t) = ℏ ∇Φ(x, t),                                                     (9)
                         δΦ(x, t) ← arg max P[target].                                               (10)
Next steps: design the Oneiro chip block diagram, simulate (1) numerically, and prototype controlled
bias experiments.
