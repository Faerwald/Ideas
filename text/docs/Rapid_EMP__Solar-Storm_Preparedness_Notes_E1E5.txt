Rapid EMP & Solar-Storm Preparedness Notes (E1–E5)
Expanded and Detailed Version
0. Purpose and Scope
This compact field manual is designed to be consulted and implemented if only mere hours of warning
are available for a large-scale electromagnetic event (man-made or solar). It condenses key quantitative
and procedural elements:
      • Understanding EMP waveforms and peak field strengths.
      • Shielding requirements, building/vehicle vulnerabilities, and testing methods.
      • Critical infrastructure at risk (grid, communications, supply chains).
      • Practical step-by-step instructions to protect electronics, data, and essential home systems.
      • Strategies for maintaining a functional life during prolonged outages of water, power, telecommu-
        nications, and finance.
Although aimed at rapid execution, deeper technical references and explanations of each protective
measure are included for clarity.
1. Threat Taxonomy
Electromagnetic pulse (EMP) events are commonly divided into various “E” components based on rise
time, duration, and coupling path. Additionally, a severe solar geomagnetic storm can induce similar
low-frequency effects to an E3 component. These overlapping phenomena define the comprehensive
threat:

1.1 Additional Context
Solar storms (Carrington-class) produce effects similar to E3, often called GICs (geomagnetically
induced currents). Large-scale transformer damage and long-duration blackouts are the chief concern.
Satellite outages and communication failures further compound the impact.

      High-power microwave (HPM) weapons that generate intense, directed bursts within line-of-sight.
                                                           1
Nuclear or non-nuclear EMP devices can produce more rapid E1-like pulses with higher field
strengths. E1 typically causes immediate failure in unprotected electronics with sensitive semiconductor
junctions.
Localized HPM weapons (E4) pose an emerging threat vector. Although narrower in geographic
scope, they can selectively disable critical infrastructure or data centers. Protective measures are similar
to E1 shielding but require attention to aperture sealing because of the high field intensity over very
short ranges.
2. Shielding Mathematics
Effective EMP mitigation centers around shielding effectiveness (SE)—the ability of a conductive en-
closure or barrier to reduce electromagnetic fields below the level that damages or disrupts electronics.
2.1 Required Shielding Effectiveness
For a worst-case E1 pulse with a peak field of Epeak = 50 kV m−1 , it’s typical to aim for a residual
field at or below the immunity threshold of small to medium-sized digital electronics, on the order of
                                             Ein ≤ 50 V m−1 .
Hence, the required shielding effectiveness (SE) in decibels is:
                                                                      
                                        Epeak               50,000 V m−1
                   SEneeded = 20 log10          = 20 log10                 = 60 dB.
                                         Ein                   50 V m−1
A 60 dB reduction means the enclosure must reduce the incident field strength by a factor of 1000.
2.2 Sheet Reflection and Absorption
Conductive barriers reduce electromagnetic waves by:
  1. Reflection at the air-metal boundary.
  2. Absorption within the thickness of the conductor.
Approximate expressions (for plane-wave incidence) are:
                               RdB ≈ 168 − 10 log10 σ − 20 log10 fMHz ,
where σ is the material conductivity in S/m and fMHz is the frequency in MHz.
                                                         r
                                             t               2
                                    AdB = 8.7 ,    δ=            .
                                             δ             ωµ0 σ
Here, t is the sheet thickness, and δ is the skin depth (the depth at which the electromagnetic wave is
attenuated by about 37%).
Material (thickness)       f = 10 MHz       RdB          δ   AdB
Aluminum foil 16 µm         ≈ 10 MHz       148 dB 27 µm 5 dB =⇒ ∼ 153 dB total
Galvanized steel 0.4 mm     ≈ 10 MHz       145 dB 16 µm 220 dB =⇒ ∼ 365 dB total
In practical terms, apertures (gaps, seams, cable feedthroughs) dominate real-world enclosures: even
thin metal foil without large gaps can exceed the required 60 dB to 80 dB if carefully sealed. A well-
sealed metal trash can or properly constructed Faraday bag generally provides 50–70 dB of attenuation,
sufficient to protect most small electronics from E1-level pulses.
                                                     2
2.3 Aperture Leakage
A crucial factor in any Faraday enclosure is the maximum dimension of any gap or slot. The approximate
shielding effectiveness for a slot of half-width a at frequency f (where λ is the wavelength) is:
                                                                 
                                                                  λ
                                          SEslot (f ) ≈ 20 log10 2πa .
For 100 MHz (λ = 3 m), if a = 1 mm,
                                                                   
                                                        3m
                              SE ≈ 20 log10                             ≈ 64 dB.
                                                  2π × 1 × 10−3 m
But if a grows to 0.5 m (e.g. a wide gap in a garage door), SE ≈ 3 dB, which is almost no shielding
effect.
This underscores why doors, seams, and cable feedthroughs must be carefully sealed or fitted with
gaskets, conductive tapes, or mechanical clamping to reduce effective gap size.
3. Scale Analysis of Vulnerabilities
3.1 Personal Cage (Small Faraday Enclosures)
A metal ammo can, sealed trash can, or nested Faraday bags can achieve 50–70 dB of shielding if the
seam is less than ∼ 1 mm. This is typically enough to keep small electronics (radios, solid-state drives,
backup inverters, laptop boards, etc.) functioning post-EMP/E3.
3.2 Residential Buildings
   • Standard wood or drywall walls have σ ≈ 10−14 S m−1 and provide negligible attenuation for
     high-frequency pulses.
   • Window glass, plastic siding, or open door frames become unintentional apertures.
   • Internal electrical wiring can act as an antenna, picking up and distributing damaging currents
     to attached devices.
Houses are generally transparent to high-frequency E1/E4 pulses unless additional shielding measures
(metal roofing, mesh screens, grounded metal siding) are implemented.
3.3 Vehicles
   • Modern steel unibody cars typically offer 20–30 dB shielding. While the steel provides extremely
     high absorption and reflection, real leakage occurs around door seams, windows, and plastic body
     parts.
   • EMP Commission tests have shown that up to 10% of tested vehicles might stall under a severe
     E1 field (50 kV m−1 ), but most can be restarted without permanent damage.
   • Diesel engines with minimal electronics are at lower risk, although electronic injection systems in
     newer models remain vulnerable to short pulses.
3.4 Power Grid Infrastructure
   • Large Transformers on the transmission grid can sustain direct E1 impulses or prolonged
     E3-induced quasi-DC saturation currents. This leads to catastrophic core heating and winding
     failures.
                                                      3
   • High-Voltage (HV) Lines spanning kilometers pick up E1/E3 pulses, channeling thousands of
     amperes into substation transformers.
   • Replacement lead-times can be 12–24 months per Extra-High-Voltage (EHV) unit, with limited
     manufacturing capacity worldwide.
4. Six-Hour Rapid-Shield Protocol
If a severe geomagnetic storm or credible EMP attack is announced with only hours of lead time,
prioritize the following steps to protect critical personal electronics:
  1. Shop (T + 0–90 min):
      (a) Acquire a 31-gallon (or similar size) galvanized steel trash can with a tight-fitting lid.
      (b) Purchase copper or aluminum foil tape, cardboard for lining, Mil-spec Faraday bags, and a
          Type-1 whole-house surge protector (SPD).
      (c) If feasible, gather extra supplies: additional gas cans, food, water, and basic medical items.
  2. Assemble (< 20 min):
      (a) Cut and fit cardboard sheets to line the interior walls of the metal can (prevent direct contact
          with devices).
      (b) Tape the rim with conductive foil tape to ensure a continuous electrical contact when the
          lid is closed.
      (c) Place essential electronics (backup radios, hard drives, a small laptop, spare power inverters)
          inside Faraday bags if available, then into the lined can.
      (d) Clamp the lid securely. Optionally, ground the can to a cold-water pipe or grounding rod—
          though for E1, a good seal is usually higher priority than grounding.
  3. Verify:
      (a) Put a handheld VHF/UHF radio transmitter inside the can. Attempt to receive its signal
          on another device outside.
      (b) If the outside receiver is silent, you have an estimated > 40 dB attenuation (usually suffi-
          cient).
      (c) For better testing, use an AM or FM radio inside the can and see if station reception
          significantly drops or disappears.
  4. Panel SPD Installation (< 1 h):
      (a) At your main electrical service panel, install or verify the Type-1 SPD (these are designed
          to clamp very high transient voltages).
      (b) If time permits, add or check Type-2 SPDs on sub-panels and critical branch circuits (e.g.
          well pump, furnace).
      (c) Disconnect nonessential electronics or turn off breakers to reduce potential coupling paths.
  5. Stand-Down:
      (a) During NOAA (Space Weather Prediction Center) or local authority alerts of Kp≥ 7 or an
          imminent EMP threat, open the main breaker to isolate your home from grid-induced surges.
      (b) Maintain essential loads (fridge, minimal lighting, radio) from a generator or battery bank.
      (c) If possible, store or shield the generator in a cage-lined shed when not running.
Note: Balancing speed and thoroughness is critical. In an actual crisis, focus first on small essential
electronics that enable communication, power generation management, and personal security.
                                                   4
5. What Remains Unprotected
Even with robust personal shielding, the following large-scale systems are highly vulnerable:
   • Utility HV Transformers & Substations: Bulk power distribution can be disabled for months
     or years if major transformers fail.
   • Long-Haul Fiber Repeaters & Communication Hubs: Although fiber itself is not a good
     antenna for high-frequency E1, the repeater electronics can be compromised.
   • Data Centers (Cloud & LLM infrastructure): Backup diesel generators typically have fuel
     for 24–72 hours. If re-supply chains fail or electronics are damaged, servers go offline.
   • Pipelines, Rail Signaling, ATMs, Cold-Chain Storage: Industrial SCADA systems, control
     relays, and refrigeration controls can all fail due to direct or indirect coupling from E1 or E3 pulses.
6. Economic & Social Ramifications
Nation-wide blackout scenarios following an EMP or large-scale solar storm can lead to:
   • GDP Contraction: Economic activity halved within weeks; a real GDP drop ¿30% in the first
     year is plausible due to the collapse of electronic finance and manufacturing.
   • Food Supply Chain Collapse: Most cities have at most 30 days of stored food; rural areas
     60 days. Without power, refrigeration and distribution fail quickly.
   • Loss of Digital Commerce: Electronic payment systems vanish. Cash on hand, precious
     metals, and barter can become dominant transaction methods.
   • Critical Labor Shortages: Skilled trades (mechanics, farmers, electricians) become essential.
     Large segments of the service economy find themselves unemployed or repurposed.
Recovery Clock:
  1. Days: Hospital generators exhaust diesel; major medical services degrade.
  2. Weeks: Perishable food stockpiles spoil; telecom backup batteries deplete.
  3. 6–18 Months: First new EHV transformers could arrive if international supply chains remain
     partially functional.
  4. 4–10 Years: Full grid re-synchronization after a Carrington-scale event (per National Academy
     of Sciences estimates).
7. Thriving Strategy
While surviving is the first priority, thriving post-event means building enough redundancy and local
capability.
   • Power Autonomy:
        – 1–2 kW of solar panels, plus LiFePO4 battery bank. Keep a spare charge controller (MPPT)
          and inverter control board in a Faraday enclosure.
        – If possible, have a backup means of generating electricity (small wind turbine, micro-hydro,
          or well-shielded generator).
                                                     5
   • Water Security:
        – Gravity-fed or manual pump system.
        – Ceramic or reverse-osmosis filtration.
        – Chlorine bleach or pool shock for sterilization of stored water.
   • Food Security:
        – At least 12 months of shelf-stable foods (beans, rice, wheat, canned vegetables).
        – Heirloom seeds for regenerative gardening.
        – Low-power refrigeration or DC chest freezer on a protected, solar-powered circuit.
   • Communications:
        – HF or GMRS radio for regional contact. Keep them shielded.
        – Printed frequency lists and operating instructions.
        – Maintain an offline reference library (on SSD or USB) stored in a Faraday bag.
   • Skills:
        – Mechanical repair, first-aid, off-grid electrical, food growing and preservation.
        – Establish a neighborhood or local mutual-aid network before any crisis.
   • Security:
        – Layered physical defenses (fencing, door reinforcement, locks).
        – Low-profile or “minimal signature” approach to avoid drawing attention.
8. E5 Preparedness Note
E5 is a worst-case composite scenario (simultaneous E1 + E3, plus localized HPM or repeated
pulses). Preparation builds on E1/E3 readiness but requires:
   • Multiple Nested Cages exceeding 80 dB total shielding, ensuring that even if one layer is
     compromised by partial seam failure, deeper layers remain intact.
   • Redundant Spares On-Site: For every critical PCB or control system. No single point of
     failure should exist.
   • Local Data and AI: Avoid total reliance on cloud infrastructure. Maintain local backups of
     operating systems, productivity tools, critical design documents, offline small LLM models on an
     SSD kept in a cage. Keep printed schematics when possible.
The goal is to continue core functions (power, water, computing, communications) with minimal outside
support if the grid and large data centers fail entirely.
