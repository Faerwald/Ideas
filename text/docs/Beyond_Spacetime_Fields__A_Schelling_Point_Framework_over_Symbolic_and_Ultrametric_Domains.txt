1. Introduction
In traditional physics, a field is commonly defined as an assignment of physical quantities (such as
scalar or vector values) to every point in spacetime. This definition relies on a manifold structure that
models spacetime as a smooth, continuous entity.
    However, the necessity of spacetime as a foundational structure for defining fields may be questioned.
This document explores the generalization of fields beyond spacetime, motivated by ideas from symbolic
cognition, p-adic mathematics, ultrametric topology, and Schelling point theory. We develop a rigor-
ous mathematical and conceptual framework for defining fields over more abstract domains—such as
symbolic configuration spaces and information-structured graphs—while preserving locality, recurrence,
and attractor behavior.
2. What is a Field?
2.1 Classical Field Definition
A field is a function that assigns a value to every point in a domain. In standard physics:
   • The domain is typically spacetime, denoted M , a smooth 4-dimensional Lorentzian manifold.
   • The codomain (or value space) V can be:
         – A scalar field: ϕ : M → R,
         – A vector field: Aµ : M → R4 ,
         – A spinor field: ψ : M → Cn ,
         – Or a gauge field: Aµ : M → g, where g is a Lie algebra.
2.2 Generalized Field Definition
More abstractly, a field is a function:
                                                ϕ:X→V
where:
   • X: base space of points (traditionally spacetime),
   • V : value space (space of field values),
   • ϕ: the assignment (field) over X.
  This definition allows generalization by replacing X with any structured set, not necessarily a
manifold.
                                                    1
3. What Structure is Necessary for a Field?
To generalize field theory beyond spacetime, we must ask: what minimal structure does the domain X
require?
   • A set of distinguishable points or events,
   • A way to compare or relate nearby points (e.g., topology, metric, partial order),
   • A value space V to assign,
   • Optionally, rules for transport or interaction (e.g., connections, locality).
   This allows us to define fields over discrete sets, trees, graphs, causal sets, symbolic sequences, and
p-adic spaces.
4. p-Adic Numbers and Ultrametric Spaces
4.1 Definition of p-adic Norm
The p-adic absolute value | · |p on Q is defined as:
                                                  a
                           |x|p = p−k if x = pk ,          a, b not divisible by p.
                                                  b
4.2 Ultrametric Property
The p-adic metric satisfies a stronger triangle inequality:
                                       |x + y|p ≤ max(|x|p , |y|p ),
which defines an ultrametric space. The topology of such spaces is hierarchical and tree-like, making
them ideal for modeling nested memory structures and symbolic hierarchies.
4.3 Fields over p-adic Spaces
Let ϕ : Qnp → C define a p-adic field. Locality is hierarchical: two points are close if they share a long
common prefix in their p-adic expansions.
5. Symbolic Configuration Spaces
Let Σ denote the space of symbolic sequences:
                                     Σ = {s = s1 s2 s3 · · · | si ∈ A},
where A is a finite alphabet. A metric can be defined via:
                               d(s, t) = 2−n   where n = min{i | si ̸= ti }.
This makes Σ a compact ultrametric space. Fields on Σ can model memory, symbolic recurrence, or
information density.
6. Schelling Point Calculus (SPC)
6.1 Definition of Schelling Point
A Schelling point is a location of focal coordination in the absence of communication. We formalize
this via recurrence across symbolic paths.
    Let T = {Ti } be a set of symbolic trajectories, and define:
                                           ρ(x) := #{Ti ∋ x},
the number of paths intersecting point x. Points with large ρ(x) are Schelling attractors.
                                                       2
6.2 Schelling Field
Define the Schelling field Φ : X → R≥0 such that:
                                 Φ(x) = ρ(x) or Φ(x) = lim µt (x),
                                                            t→∞
where µt is a time-dependent recurrence measure.
7. Information-Theoretic Fields
Let X be a symbolic or cognitive configuration space. Define:
   • Φ(x) ∈ R≥0 : frequency, information value, or mutual predictability,
   • S(x): symbolic entropy,
   • K(x): Kolmogorov complexity.
   The dynamics of the field may follow:
                                         dΦ
                                            = −∇S(x) + η(t),
                                         dt
where η(t) is a noise term. Alternatively, one can define a symbolic partition function:
                                                 X
                                            Z=      e−βK(x) ,
                                                x∈X
to study concentration of measure over symbolic attractors.

9. Conclusion and Outlook
This document has proposed a rigorous generalization of the notion of a field beyond its classical
dependence on spacetime. By framing fields as functions over symbolic or ultrametric spaces, we unlock
new applications in cognition, retrocausality, memory theory, and hypercomputational logic. Schelling
points, p-adic distances, and symbolic attractors offer fertile ground for modeling informational flows
that do not depend on geometry as traditionally understood.
