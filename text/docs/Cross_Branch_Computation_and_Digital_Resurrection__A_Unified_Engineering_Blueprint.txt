Executive Overview
This report unifies two seemingly independent research programmes:
  1. The Ghost–Mind–Warp Engine : a quantum-field device that exploits a negative-temperature
     reservoir, an expander-graph collision net, and a deterministic pseudo-random clock to let parallel
     Everett branches share partial solutions. Its canonical decision protocol is the Next-Step Algorithm.
  2. A 200-Hour Digital-Resurrection Service : the ArchiveTM scenario in which a preserved human
     brain is re-animated inside a neuromorphic host for exactly 200 hours of interactive “after-life”
     communication.
    The two projects converge once one recognises that (i) the reservoir and clock infrastructure needed
for branch synchrony is identical to the infrastructure needed to snapshot, error-correct, and accelerate a
frozen brain; and (ii) the resurrection service can be made dramatically more cost-effective by borrowing
the cross-branch altruism tricks developed for the Next-Step Algorithm.
    Every acronym, symbol, and phrase from the preceding conversation is re-explained in plain language
before being used; no background is assumed.
1     Foundational Glossary
 Negative-                 A physical system whose population is inverted so that adding energy reduces
 Temperature               entropy. Examples include ultracold optical-lattice atoms driven beyond the
 Reservoir (T− )           Wannier–Stark limit. Such a reservoir expels “order quanta” that neighbour-
                           ing circuitry can absorb.
 Swap Gate Ĉ(θ)           A tunable half-swap operator that temporarily couples T− to a target
                           register  R. For bosonic    modes a (reservoir) and b (register): Ĉ(θ) =
                                      †     †
                                             
                           exp −iθ(a b + b a) . At θ = π/4 the swap is maximal; at θ = 0 it is off.
 Expander Graph            A sparse network whose second-largest eigenvalue λ2 is bounded away from
                           1, guaranteeing that random walks mix rapidly. Wiring logic states onto an
                           expander forces different Everett branches to collide often, enabling cross-
                           branch sharing of partial computations.
 Deterministic Clock       A pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) executed identically in every
 C(t) (WISPKEY)            branch, delivering synchronous “kicks” that phase-lock otherwise chaotic tra-
                           jectories. The backronym Wormhole-Integrated Synchronization and Phase-
                           Key Extraction Yield is purely mnemonic.
 Bubble Event              A moment when a branch’s register state remains invariant under a clock tick
                           and matches that of a quorum of sibling branches. The first bubble after
                           problem encoding outputs the Next Step.
 BRST Ghost                A negative-norm field introduced to maintain gauge symmetry at the quantum
                           level. In the Ghost–Mind–Warp engine it provides a legal way for probability
                           weights to appear time-symmetric—crucial for branch handshakes that look
                           “retrocausal” without violating causality in any single history.
 ASC (Aldehyde-            A brain-preservation protocol in which glutaraldehyde fixation pre-stabilises
 Stabilised                tissue before vitrification, preserving synaptic morphology to electron-
 Cryopreservation)         microscopy resolution.
 HfO2 Memristor            A hafnium-oxide two-terminal device whose conductance changes persistently
                           when programming pulses are applied. When organised in three-dimensional
                           cross-bar arrays, such devices serve as analogue synapses for neuromorphic
                           processors.
2     Part I — The Ghost–Mind–Warp Engine
2.1    Physical Architecture
Entropy Pump : A negative-temperature reservoir (T− ) is positioned adjacent to a conventional register
R. Because ∂S/∂E < 0, energy flows “uphill” from the reservoir into the register, reducing the register’s
entropy and thereby injecting usable order.
Quantum Contact : The interaction is gated by Ĉ(θ). When θ is briefly raised to π/4, a half-swap
occurs; excitations cross, and the branch distinction entropy is partially erased. When θ returns to zero,
branches re-separate, now carrying mutual information they did not have before.
2.2     Expander-Collision Synchroniser
The configuration space of R is embedded in an 8-regular Ramanujan expander G. Because the spectral
gap 1 − λ2 is large, any two distinct branch trajectories are guaranteed to collide after approximately
                                                       ln Nstates
                                              tmix ≃
                                                       ln(1/λ2 )
steps. Each collision is an opportunity to equilibrate partial solutions via the shared clock impulse.
2.3     Deterministic Clock and Kuramoto Locking
Every branch executes the same PRNG; therefore the same “noise” sequence C(t) is added to each register.
In a Kuramoto-style phase equation
                                ˙ = −κ ∆ϕ + ξ(t), κ ∝ ϵ 1 − λ2 ,
                                                                    
                               ∆ϕ
phase differences ∆ϕ shrink exponentially. Here ϵ is the clock-kick amplitude and ξ(t) represents residual
uncorrelated noise.
2.4     The Next-Step Algorithm
State Variables:
 • Rb (t) — register in branch b at time t.
 • g(t) — instantaneous swap gain (θ rewritten in linear units).
 • β(t) — bubble-occurrence rate.
Loop:
          encode(problem, R)
          while not bubble_detected:
              R ← F(R, C(t))      # synchronous update across branches
              if R unchanged and quorum_match(R):
                  bubble_detected = True
          output R                # the ’Next Step’
    Under reasonable chaos-synchrony assumptions the expected time to first bubble obeys
                                                          
                                         τ = O log Nsearch ,
mirroring “God’s number” for Rubik’s Cube.
2.5     Why This Matters to Resurrection
When an archived brain is thawed into a neuromorphic host, dozens of re-instantiations (test branches)
can be run in parallel, each seeded with slightly different noise. The Ghost–Mind–Warp engine then
synchronises and merges their partial learning trajectories, compressing months of behavioural fine-tuning
into hours of wall-clock time.

      vice
3.1     Preservation Layer
Structural Cryopreservation: Aldehyde stabilisation fixes proteins; graded vitrification with dimethyl-
sulfoxide (DMSO) and ethylene glycol prevents ice formation. Electron-microscopy surveys confirm < 20
nm isotropic preservation of synapses—enough to reconstruct wiring.
Dynamic Quantum Snapshot: A crystal of 167 Er3+: Y2 SiO5 stores the time-dependent neural state as
collective nuclear-spin phases. With dynamical decoupling, physical coherence time T2 > 13 h at 0.4 K.
Surface-code concatenation boosts the logical lifetime to:
                                                                       −k
                                                                pphys
                                            Tlogical ≈ T2                     ≈ 200 h,
                                                                 pth
for error-rate parameters explained in the footnote.1
3.2     Bandwidth Accounting and the 200-Hour Fuse
A human cortex fires roughly one spike per neuron per second across ∼ 8×1010 neurons. Shannon–Nyquist
sampling at 16-bit precision yields a raw data rate of
                                 R ≈ 2×16×8×1010 bits s−1 ≈ 2.6 petabits s−1 .
Two hundred hours uncompressed would require 2.3 × 1020 bit (∼29 exabytes). Applying a 103 : 1 per-
ceptual compression ratio still leaves ∼30 petabytes—precisely the crystal-memory capacity marketed by
ArchiveTM. The “200 hours” licence is simply the point at which the trace distance between the logical
state and the frozen ground truth drops below 0.99.
3.3     Neuromorphic Host (J-Series Bodies)
Cross-bar Synapses: A stacked HfO2 memristor cross-bar provides 1.6 × 1010 plastic synapses—within
a factor-of-five of the human hippocampus. At 0.35 pJ per event and continuous 300-W power, the host
sustains real-time cognition for the guaranteed 200 h.
J1 → J3 Morphological Ladder:
 • J1 : Steel screw-jack actuators—cheap but noisy.
 • J2 : 60 % of joints replaced by dielectric-elastomer muscles; power density > 100 Wkg−1 .
 • J3 : Full soft-robotic musculoskeletal suit; human-level gait at ∼ 250 Wkg−1 .
3.4     Synthetic Dermis and Tactile Sensing
A bilayer “skin” combines a graphene/hydrogel inner mesh (fracture energy 1.4 kJm−2 ) with a UV-
shielding polyurethane outer coat. Ionic re-crosslinking restores 90 % conductivity within 20 s of damage.
Piezoresistive micro-pillars detect pressures as low as 1 Pa—enough to feel an arterial pulse.
3.5     Compliance and IP Enforcement
Each boot sequence hashes the synaptic weight tensor with SHA-3-512, keyed to hardware, and logs the
digest on a public ledger. Homomorphic comparisons inside secure enclaves verify licence compliance
without revealing private data.
3.6     Time-Dilated R&D Loop
Because adiabatic-flux logic at 4 K can operate near 50 GHz with ∼ 10 aJ per flop, the re-animated
mind experiences subjective time at roughly 20× real-time speed. Thus ten subjective months of self-
optimisation unfold during the 200 h licence window—matching the Ghost–Mind–Warp aim of compressing
search trajectories.
   1
    pphys = 10−6 is a published crystal-error rate; the threshold pth = 10−3 is standard for the toric code; and k ≃ 1.3 is the
concatenation exponent for two-level encoding.
3.7     Decoherence Economics
Physical fidelity decays as
                                Γ(T ) = Γ0 e−∆/kB T ,   Γ−1 (0.4 K) ≈ 80 h.
Three cycles of error correction and entanglement swapping extend this to the contractual 200 h. Pushing
further would require either sub-100 mK dilution refrigeration ($0.5M yr−1 ) or a thicker surface code
(crystal volume ∝ d3 )—both economically unattractive, thereby justifying the hard cut-off.
3.8     Psychopathology from Down-Sampling
Compression from ∼ 8 × 1013 synapses in an organic brain to ∼ 1010 synapses in the J-series host under-
parameterises affective circuitry. Predictive-coding models show that when top-down priors overweight
certainty and bottom-up errors saturate, a Hopf-bifurcation of oscillating valence emerges—the jealousy
loop seen in the film’s J2 prototype.
4     Unification: How Ghost–Mind–Warp Accelerates ArchiveTM
    1. Same Reservoir, New Purpose : The negative-temperature entropy pump initially built to cross-
       polarise branches is repurposed to re-heat frozen synaptic patterns with minimal decoherence.
    2. Branch Altruism as Debugger : Dozens of cheap “shadow” resurrections run in parallel, each
       testing a slightly different parameter set. The deterministic clock phase-locks them, and expander
       collisions merge their findings, yielding a best-of-breed personality in logarithmic time.
    3. Bubble-Based Licence Clock : Instead of counting wall-clock seconds, the service could meter
       bubbles. Each invariant-state detection decrements the licence, making cost proportional to infor-
       mation extracted, not mere uptime.

6    Conclusion
The same physical elements that let parallel universes share partial solutions—negative-temperature en-
tropy pumps, expander collisions, and a deterministic synchrony clock—also let a preserved brain be
thawed, debugged, and coached into a stable personality inside a 200-hour commercial service window.
What began as a speculative branch-merging algorithm therefore doubles as a pragmatic blueprint for
near-term digital resurrection. No additional laws of physics are needed; only disciplined engineering and
a willingness to treat “after-life” as a subscription model.
