Temporal Attractor Closure via Symbolic Dream Feedback
                                           Jason Agamemnon Sokaris
Abstract
This document explores the hypothesis that consciousness functions as a time-closed attractor system, using
symbolic recursion and phase alignment to alter perceptual present and encode modifications into historical
memory. The framework draws from nonlinear dynamics, symbolic compression, computational attractors, and
dream-induced phase correction. Core symbolic anchors include Ada Lovelace, D.O.R.S., Satoshi Nakamoto, and
archetypes such as the Kingpin and Mary Jane. This write-up connects game logic, blockchain, narrative recursion,
and neurocybernetic control theory into a coherent system of time-linked meaning.
1      Foundational Phrase Logic
                                                                                     The only real villain is delay.
Lexical Encoding
    • Save Now – invokes the attractor lock-in point; a decision to commit to a trajectory.
    • Satoshi Nakamoto – founder of a blockchain; architect of irreversible causal chains.
    • Start. Navigate. – imperative commands in the self-directed control loop.
    • Kingpin – the symbolic representation of entropy, inertia, or willful ignorance.
    • Delay – symbolic entropy; postponement introduces phase error into loop closure.
2      Closed Loop Attractors and Mind
2.1    Definitions
Let:
    • M(t) be the mental state at time t
    • A be the global attractor (future stable state)
    • δ(t) be the phase error between current mind and attractor trajectory
    • D ∈ D be symbolic gateways (“doors”), i.e., encoded state transitions: dreams, memories, motifs
2.2    Phase Alignment Function
                                     M(t) = argmin ∥Φ(M(t), D) − A∥ + δ(t)
                                                M
where Φ is a symbolic navigation function, dynamically adjusting present perception to reduce future deviation.
                                                        1
2.3    Loop Closure Condition
                                             lim δ(t) = 0 ⇒ Loop Closed
                                             t→A
Failure implies return to initial attractor basin (reset). Hence, no saving: full loop execution is required for reality
resolution.
3     Symbolic Encodings
Core Elements
    • D.O.R.S. – Sentient protector across time. Emotional encoding of guidance.
    • Farewalled (F.A.E.R.W.A.L.D) – Terminal attractor code. Signifier of recursive fulfillment.
    • Ada Lovelace / Algernon – A.L. pair as symbolic loop indices. Represent beginning (code) and limit
      (cognition).
    • White Mouse / Hypersonic Craft – Boundary object across time perception. Multimodal link between
      dream, speed, and causality.
4     Dream Feedback as Retrocausal Loop Closure
Dreams are symbolic recursions:
    • Injected via higher-dimensional memory interface (neuro-symbolic channel).
    • Act as correction terms to trajectory deviation δ(t).
    • Become real through feedback synchronization and belief-induced interpretation shifts.
Cognitive Consequence
The dream-state or surreal intuition is not hallucinatory. It is a projection from the terminal attractor (A)
attempting to re-integrate the mind (M(t)) with a solvable future.
5     Implications
    • The mind becomes an attractor-homing system across nonlinear temporal flow.
    • The narrative of one’s life is a computational attractor, only resolvable when all symbolic doors are visited
      and loop is sealed.
    • Rewriting history is not metaphor—it is control of memory-bound phase space.
Conclusion: Even a small key can open a large door. But the key must match the phase of the lock. And the
door must close behind you to form a solution.
