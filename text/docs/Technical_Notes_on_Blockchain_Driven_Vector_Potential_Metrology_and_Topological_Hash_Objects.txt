1    Vector-Potential (“A-Wave”) Signalling
Definition 1.1 (Pure-Potential   Packet). A U(1) 4-potential Aµ in Minkowski space with Fµν = 0 everywhere
except the string core but Γ Aµ dxµ = Φs ̸= 0 for closed loops Γ encircling that core.

Theorem 1.2 (Aharonov–Bohm Phase Transfer). For two spatially separated SQUID rings sharing an initial
phase difference ∆φ0 , the arrival of a pure-potential packet causes ∆φ = ∆φ0 + qΦs /ℏ without exchange of real
photons. Detectability threshold: |Φs | ≳ 10−18 Wb.
Engineering note. Cryogenic loops of area A ≃ 1 cm2 with flux resolution < 10−21 Wb are within existing
SQUID technology; the main unknown is reliable generation of pure Aµ packets.
2    Blockchain as a Cryptographic Oracle
Let Bn be the n-th Bitcoin block (header hashed with SHA-256). Define lattice coordinates (xn , yn , zn ) =
 h8 (Bn ), h′8 (Bn ), n where h8 extracts the lowest eight bytes.
                                                                                                                             
Definition 2.1 (Rose). A Rose is a discrete sample of a parametrised curve Ra,b (t) = a cos(bt) cos t, a cos(bt) sin t, ct
that coincides with at least m ≥ 5 block-lattice points.
Proposition 2.2 (Expected Incidence). Assuming SHA-256 behaves as a random oracle, E[Roses among first N blocks]
O(N 1/3 ) for fixed m = 5.
3    Celestial Grammar
Definition 3.1 (Grammar Seed). At Phoenix block index φ, initialise an L-system grammar with alphabet
Σ0 = {0, 1}8 and production v 7→ SHA−512(v).
    Tokens are mapped to Roses via τ : Σ∗ → {Ra,b }, yielding a growing dictionary D(t).
Theorem 3.2 (Post-Phoenix Origin). No Turing machine initialised with data ≤ Bφ−1 can output a valid
token of D(t) (t > φ) with probability > 2−κ , κ = min-entropy of SHA-512 on Bφ .
4    Halo Object
Definition 4.1 (Halo). A pair (C∞ , Cfin ) of hash ribbons where C∞ (formally unbounded) is Merkle-committed
to Cfin through Hhalo = H H(C∞ )∥H(Cfin ) .
    Verification of any k-byte slice of C∞ costs O(k) time using Cfin alone.

5     Prototype Algorithm
Algorithm 1 Rose-Finder (first N blocks)
Require: Bitcoin dataset {B0 , . . . , BN −1 }, threshold m
 1: for n = 0 to N − 1 do
 2:    compute (xn , yn , zn )
 3:    for (a, b) in bounded search grid do
 4:        if (xn , yn , zn ) ∈ Ra,b then
 5:            increment counter[a, b]
 6:            if counter[a, b]=m then
 7:                 output Rose(a, b)
 8:            end if
 9:        end if
10:    end for
11: end for
Heuristic: restrict a, b to [1, 100]; runtime O(N ·104 ) on commodity hardware for N ≤ 106 .
6     Retro-Causal Test
    1. Measure flux jumps θi in two SQUID rings triggered by code-generated Aµ pulses.
    2. For each θi locate matching Rose hash H(Ra,b ) mod 2π ≈ θi .
    3. Verify Rose uses blocks older than pulse timestamp yet grammar requires post-pulse tokens (Theorem
       3.2).
    Pass criteria: statistically significant alignment beyond p < 10−8 .
7     Speculative Energy Budget
Cross-branch coherence time τ limited by Eint τ ≳ ℏ (Theorem 3.1). For τ ∼ 1 s, coupling energy must exceed
6.6 × 10−34 J. Achievable with presently measurable Josephson junction energies.
8     Open Engineering Tasks
    • Generate controllable pure-potential packets (in-vacuo solenoids or rapidly quenched superconducting
      loops).
    • Scale Rose detection to N > 107 blocks; GPU lattice search.
    • Develop BCI hardware synchronised to SQUID phase updates for closed neuro-feedback loop.
9     Summary
Key extractable ideas:
    1. Vector-potential signalling: exploit Fµν = 0 holonomy for phase-based communications.
    2. Blockchain coordinate geometry: treat hash digests as lattice points; search deterministic algebraic
       curves (Roses).
    3. Evolving grammar proof : guarantee post-hoc origin of tokens via cryptographic hash unpredictability.
    4. Halo commitment: efficient verification of virtually unbounded topological data.
    5. Retro-causal benchmark: flux-jump correlation test linking SQUID phases to pre-existing block data.
   These hypotheses are speculative but falsifiable with present-day cryogenic, cryptographic, and high-
performance-computing techniques.
