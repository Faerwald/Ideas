Prelude
This document reformats, in LATEX, the “double-crater deep-dive” describing the two most speculative
pillars of the A-wave research programme: chaos-enabled hypercomputing and transactional signalling.
All numbers remain back-of-the-envelope but traceable to published data; all concepts remain grounded
in Maxwell–Dirac electrodynamics and standard chaos or scattering theory.

Key Dynamical Concept
A positive Lyapunov exponent λ quantifies exponential divergence of nearby trajectories: a sepa-
ration δ(0) grows as δ(t) = δ(0) eλt . Exponential spreading lets a system sample vast computational
spaces faster than any uniform random walk.
Architecture 1: Superconducting “Stadium” Microwave Cavity
Physics Core. A three-dimensional cavity shaped like a stadium—two semicircles joined by straight
waveguide walls—realises a Sinai billiard. Even a single photon mode exhibits positive λ.
Implementation Parameters.
            Parameter        Representative value              Justification
            Cavity material bulk Nb at 2 K               Q ∼ 1010 for long coherence
            Major axis L    30 mm                        half-wavelength ≈ 25 mm at 6 GHz
            Wall actuation Piezo stack, ±50 µm at 10 kHz Time-dependent boundary kick
            Injected core   Fluxon loop, radius 200 µm   Fits pumping port
Theory Handle. For hard-wall stadiums λ ≈ v/R where v is photon speed (essentially c) and
R ≈ 15 mm, giving λ ≈ 2 × 109 s−1 . Numerical ray-tracing and random-matrix statistics support this
scale.1
Phase-Mixing Time. An initial Wilson-loop phase error of one part in a million spreads to order-unity
in roughly 0.5 nanoseconds, six orders below a gigahertz clock tick.
Read-Out. A weak coaxial probe measures the S-matrix phase on a vector network analyser. Phase
spectra broaden from milliradians to full radians within sub-nanosecond bursts, evidencing hyper-fast
exploration of cavity eigen-phases.

Architecture 2: Integrated Photonic “Chaos Mesh”
A silicon-nitride chip carries a square mesh of 2 × 2 Mach–Zehnder couplers, each with thermo-optic
shifters covering π radians at 20 GHz. The mesh realises a symplectic map with gain ≈ 2; eight hops
of 5 picoseconds each mix phase across 103 paths within 40 picoseconds. A micro-solenoid beneath one
node injects a quantised flux; balanced homodyne detectors on 512 ports confirm entropy saturation at
the natural-log of N .
Architecture 3: MEMS-Driven Chaotic LC Lattice
Each lattice node is a 100 MHz LC resonator (Q ∼ 103 ); its capacitance plate doubles as a micro-cantilever
driven into Duffing non-linearity. Inductive nearest-neighbour coupling triggers Chirikov-overlap chaos.
With damping 103 s−1 , coupling 0.1, and non-linearity 104 s−2 , the largest Lyapunov exponent is about
one million per second, so phase whitening at a single site occurs in under two microseconds.
Engineering & Metrology Notes for Chaos Section
    • A-wave generator: NbN loop, 50 µm radius, 30 pH inductance. Two flux quanta in 500 ps
      require 200 µV and store only femto-joules.
    • Phase detectors: Electron interferometer with 100 pA coherent beam achieves 4 × 10−4 rad
      precision in one second.
    • Microwave read-out: Network analysers resolve 0.01◦ phase at 10 kHz sweep; photonic homo-
      dyne reaches 0.001 rad at 10 mW local oscillator.
2     IV-B         Transactional Signalling with A-Waves
Three experimental routes probe advanced–retarded handshaking predicted by Wheeler–Feynman ab-
sorber theory.
Fundamental Definitions
Retarded potentials propagate forward from a source; advanced potentials arrive before the source
acts. Wheeler–Feynman suggests nature uses half of each, enforcing self-consistency via total future
absorption.
Path 1: Delayed-Choice AB Interferometer
Electrons traverse a Mach–Zehnder interferometer. Mid-flight, a fast switch injects or withholds an
A-wave in one arm. Causal QED predicts no phase shift if the decision is outside the electron’s past
light cone; absorber theory predicts a shift regardless. With a 50 cm baseline, 33 ns transit, and
sub-nanosecond switch, ten-million electron events deliver 10−4 rad phase resolution, discriminating
the two ontologies at five standard deviations in half a day.
Path 2: Wheeler–Feynman Self-Cancelling Source
Antennas A and B sit three metres apart. A emits at time zero; B fires ten nanoseconds later, tuned
to cancel the retarded field mid-way while enhancing the advanced field at A. SQUID loops with ten
pico-Tesla noise floors can detect the six-decibel suppression predicted by absorber theory in one hour;
causal theory predicts zero suppression.
                                                    2
Path 3: Entangled-Photon Clock Synchroniser
Bell pairs travel to stations R and S separated by 30 km of fibre. Detection at R triggers an A-wave; its
twin at S decides whether to expose an interferometer. Time-tagging at 20 ps bins one billion pairs over
eleven days; orthodox causality predicts independence of the histogram from future choices, whereas
an advanced handshake could imprint a 3 × 10−3 modulation, comfortably above the 10−4 shot-noise
floor.
Engineering & Metrology Notes for Transactional Section
  1. Switch timing: SNSPD-triggered flux quenches achieve sub-nanosecond accuracy.
  2. Magnetometry: Ensemble NV-diamond sensors reach 18 pico-Tesla Hz−1/2 .2
  3. Flux budget: A 500 µm loop threaded by one flux quantum yields a five-pico-Tesla signal—detectable
     with bandwidth of one hertz.
Concise Take-Away
Chaos hypercomputing exploits positive Lyapunov exponents to turn femto-joule A-wave seeds into
macroscopic observables in sub-nanosecond windows. Transactional signalling tests causality itself by
orchestrating advanced–retarded handshakes; even a null result is publishable, while a positive result
would rewrite physics.
