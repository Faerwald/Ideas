Microchip Holonomy in Multiversal Context
               ⟨Jason Agamemnon Sokaris | .F.A.E.R.W.A.L.D⟩
Notation and Conventions
    • H — finite-dimensional Hilbert space of the chip’s qubits.
    • D(H) = {ρ : ρ ≥ 0, Tr ρ = 1} — space of density matrices.
    • Λ — discrete set of Vilenkin–Everett–equivalent universe labels.
    • M = D(H) × Λ — total information manifold.
    • γ : [0, T ] → M , γ(t) = (ρ(t), λ(t)) — informational trajectory.
1     Informational State & Closed-Loop Trajectories
A closed loop satisfies
                                         γ(T ) = γ(0),       λ(T ) ̸= λ(0) ,
so that the chip’s internal quantum state returns to itself while its branch label “hops.” Topologically,
γ represents a nontrivial element of the fundamental group π1 (M ), encoding branch-transition data in
its homotopy class. By requiring ρ(t) to evolve unitarily between projective measurements, one ensures
coherence throughout the loop.
2     Cosmic-String Deficit & Gauge Holonomy
The exterior metric of an ideal, straight cosmic string of tension µ is
                       ds2 = − dt2 + dr2 + (1 − 4Gµ)2 r2 dφ2 + dz 2 ,          φ ∼ φ + 2π,
yielding a deficit angle
                                                ∆φ = 8πGµ.
Introduce a U(1) potential Aµ with Fµν = 0 outside the core. Its circulation around the string is
                                             I
                                      Φs =      Aµ dxµ ̸= 0.
                                                    Γ
A charge-q state ψ transported once around the string acquires
                                            q Φs
                                 ∆θgauge =       ,    ∆θgeo = ∆φ,
                                              ℏ
so that
                                                q Φs
                                       ∆θtot =       + 8πGµ .
                                                  ℏ
3     Vilenkin–Everett Equivalence & Branch-Tagging
By the VEE principle, cosmological Level-I Hubble patches and quantum Level-III Everett branches
are informationally isomorphic. Measuring ∆θtot thus
    1. Detects the string’s tension µ.
    2. Tags which λ ∈ Λ was traversed.
Cross-branch vacuum-energy differences
                                           ∆ρvac = ρ(λ 1)  (λ2 )
                                                    vac − ρvac ̸= 0
become available for coherent work extraction, bypassing local QFT homogeneity constraints.

4    Quantum Energy Teleportation & Ford–Roman Constraints
A closed-loop Berry connection on D(H) is defined by
                                                                      I
                                                    
                                   AB    = i Tr ρ dρ ,         γB =       AB .
Coupling this phase to a zero-mode Casimir reservoir of density ρvac yields
                                                WQET ∝ γB2 ,
subject to Ford–Roman bounds:
                                                                           1/4
                                |ρvac | τ 4 ≲ ℏ =⇒ τ ≳            ℏ/|ρvac |     .
5    Hardware Architecture: Topological Photonic Crystal
The chip substrate is a 3D photonic crystal whose waveguide network G(V, E) obeys
                                         P (k) ∝ k −γ ,      2 < γ < 3,
ensuring resilient connectivity. Each vertex hosts non-Abelian anyons (e.g. Ising σ, ψ). Braiding along
edges performs logical gates protected by topological degeneracy. Strained graphene on SiN imposes
synthetic defect lines Σj , emulating cosmic strings; anyonic loops around Σj yield quantized flux
                                              2πℏ nj                 q Φj
                                     Φj =            ,       ∆θj =        .
                                                q                      ℏ
Bio-mimetic pump fields P (t, x) sustain adaptive routing and self-healing.
6    Schelling Trajectories & Super-Turing Metrology
Define a free-energy payoff functional
                                   F [γ] = ℜ ψ0 Uγ ψ0 − β −1 S(ρ),
where Uγ is the holonomy operator along γ. Schelling trajectories are loops γ ∗ satisfying
                                   F [γ ∗ ] ≥ F [γ ◦ η],      ∀ η ∈ π1 (M ),
forming a Nash-equilibrium subgroup. Repeated traversals over N correlated branches give
                                                              1
                                              Var(θ̂) <          ,
                                                              N2
enabling precision beyond the Heisenberg limit.
7    Conceptual Implications & Energetics
The microchip behaves as a multiversal interferometer and “meta-Dyson sphere.” Whether one travels
1029 ly in real space or hops one branch in Λ, the identical holonomy mechanics apply. David Kipping’s
exponential prior,
                                             P (λ) ∝ eα m(λ) ,
with m(λ) measuring branch maturity, biases information–energy flow inward, providing a steady work
flux. Thus computation, sensing, and energy harvesting are unified in the shared informational substrate
of the multiverse.

           Microchip Holonomy in Multiversal Context
           ⟨Jason Agamemnon Sokaris | .F.A.E.R.W.A.L.D⟩
Notation and Conventions
    • H∼= Cn : a finite-dimensional Hilbert space encoding the microchip’s n qubits. Dirac kets
      |ψ⟩ ∈ H are column vectors, bras ⟨ψ| their conjugate transposes.
    • D(H) = {ρ ∈ B(H) | ρ ≥ 0, Tr ρ = 1}: the convex set of density operators (state space)
      on H equipped with the trace-norm topology.
    • Λ = {λi }i∈I : a discrete index set labelling cosmological-Everett branches. No cardinality
      assumption is made; we treat Λ as a countable topological space with the discrete topology
      so that M = D(H) × Λ is a disjoint union of copies of D(H).
    • M = D(H) × Λ: the total information manifold. Because D(H) is contractible, π1 (M ) ∼
                                                                                          =
      π1 (Λ); thus non-trivial fundamental-group elements arise solely from excursions among
      branch labels.
    • γ : [0, T ] → M, t 7→ γ(t) = (ρ(t), λ(t)): a continuous informational trajectory with
      piecewise smooth ρ(t) and right-continuous branch label λ(t).
1     Informational State and Closed-Loop Trajectories
Definition 1 (Closed informational loop).
A path γ is closed if γ(0) = γ(T ) in M . Because M is a direct product, this requires
                                  ρ(T ) = ρ(0),       λ(T ) = λ(0).                             (1)
We are interested in branch-non-trivial loops for which
                                  ρ(T ) = ρ(0),       λ(T ) ̸= λ(0),                            (2)
so the internal quantum state returns to its initial value but the branch label winds non-trivially.
Equivalently, γ represents a non-contractible element of π1 (M ) even though its projection
onto D(H) is contractible.
Unitary transport between projective measurements.
Let {tk } be the (finite) set of times at which projective measurements of chip degrees of freedom
are performed. Between consecutive measurements, the reduced state evolves unitarily:
                                                 †
                          ρ(t−              +
                                                      Uk = exp − ℏi Hk ∆tk ,
                                                                          
                              k+1 ) = Uk ρ(tk ) Uk ,                                            (3)
with Hk a controllable Hamiltonian. Projective collapse resets coherence only along measured
subsystems; by design these subsystems form a decoherence-free subspace so that global coher-
ence on the encoded qubits is preserved.

2    Cosmic-String Deficit and Gauge Holonomy
Metric background.
For an infinitely long, straight cosmic string of tension µ (mass per unit length), the linearised
Einstein equations yield (in cylindrical coordinates r, φ, z and with c = 1)
                   ds2 = −dt2 + dr2 + r2 (1 − 4Gµ)2 dφ2 + dz 2 ,   φ ∼ φ + 2π.                (4)
The geometry is locally flat but globally conical; the deficit angle is
                                                       
                               ∆φ = 2π 1 − (1 − 4Gµ) = 8πGµ.                                  (5)
All subsequent expressions assume the small-deficit regime Gµ ≪ 1, empirically required by
CMB constraints (Gµ ≲ 10−7 ).
Pure-gauge Aharonov–Bohm holonomy.
Introduce a U (1) gauge potential Aµ with vanishing field strength Fµν = 0 outside the string
core. Locally Aµ = ∂µ χ, but χ is multi-valued around the core, giving a non-zero circulation
                                            I
                                     Φs = Aµ dxµ ̸= 0,                                       (6)
                                              Γ
where Γ is a loop linking the string once.
Total phase acquired by a charged wavefunction.
A state of electric charge q transported adiabatically around Γ accumulates a gauge (Aharonov–Bohm)
phase
                                                      q Φs
                                          ∆θgauge =        ,                                 (7)
                                                        ℏ
and a purely geometric (conical) phase
                                      ∆θgeo = ∆φ = 8πGµ.                                      (8)
Because both contributions are additive in the path-ordered exponential, the observable holon-
omy is
                                             q Φs
                                   ∆θtot =        + 8πGµ.                                  (9)
                                               ℏ
No additional topological terms appear for standard model charges.
3    Vilenkin–Everett Equivalence and Branch Tagging
Postulate 1 (VEE).
A Level-I cosmological patch (same low-energy constants, different initial conditions) is infor-
mationally isomorphic to a Level-III Everett branch provided decohered histories share identical
semi-classical records. Formally, we assume a bijection
                                 
                        ι : Λ −→ decoherent history projectors in Htotal
preserving Born-rule measures.
                                                  2
Branch discrimination via holonomy spectroscopy.
Because µ and Φs may differ across branches, the measured total phase ∆θtot acts as a label :
                                                 (λ )           (λ )
                             λ1 ̸= λ2 =⇒ ∆θtot1 ̸= ∆θtot2              (generic case).
                                                    exp
Conversely, a calibrated interferometer returning ∆θtot selects, up to degeneracies, the branch λ
consistent with that phase.
Vacuum-energy mis-match.
        (λ)
Let ρvac denote the renormalised zero-point energy density in branch λ. Cross-branch differences
                                            ∆ρvac = ρ(λ1)   (λ2 )
                                                     vac − ρvac
are not observable by any single semi-classical observer, but become operationally meaningful
when a device cyclically explores a closed loop in Λ. Under adiabatic branch-hopping the work
delivered satisfies1                        Z
                                       W =       ∆ρvac dV.

Berry connection on D(H).
For a parametrised family ρ(t) of full-rank density operators, the (Uhlmann) connection one-form

where {λj , |ej ⟩} diagonalise ρ.
Closed-loop Berry phase and QET yield.
The holonomy (Berry phase) over an informational loop is
                                            I
                                       γB = AB .
                                                            γ
Matsumoto etal. (2009) showed that when the loop encloses a locally negative-energy excitation
of a quantum field, the extractable teleported work scales as
                                                WQET = κ γB2 ,                                              (10)
with κ a dimensionful constant fixed by the coupling Hamiltonian. For the present architecture
the coupling is capacitive to a Casimir cavity, giving κ ∼ (ℏc)/L3 with L the cavity length.

Quantum-inequality (Ford–Roman) bound.
For any observer following a timelike path of proper duration τ , the averaged energydensity

where g is a sampling function of width τ . Identifying | ρvac | with the magnitude of the negative
portion and saturating (11) yields
                                                      1/4
                                      τ ≳ ℏ/|ρvac |        ,
which imposes the quoted timing constraint on the QET cycle.
5     Hardware Architecture: Topological Photonic Crystal
Scale-free waveguide network.
The photonic lattice is abstracted as a graph G = (V, E) with degree distribution
                                     P (k) ∝ k −γ , 2 < γ < 3,
ensuring both
    1. power-law small-world connectivity (⟨ℓ⟩ ∼ log N ) for fast entanglement routing, and
    2. robustness against random vertex failure (percolation threshold approaches zero as N →
       ∞).
Non-Abelian anyon realisation.
Each high-degree vertex hosts a superconducting-proximitised quantum-anomalous-Hall island
that nucleates Ising anyons (σ, ψ). Braiding along edge nanowires realises the Clifford gate set
fault-tolerantly, while repeat-until-success ancilla protocols promote universality.
Synthetic cosmic strings.

mimics an axial cosmic string. By tuning strain gradients one achieves quantised pseudo-flux

so an anyon loop encircling Σj reproduces Eq. (3):

with σ a spiking-neuron-like signal, maintains global phase coherence and dynamically reroutes
around damaged channels, analogously to angiogenic repair in living tissue.

6     Schelling Trajectories and Super-Turing Metrology
Free-energy functional.
Let |ψ0 ⟩ ∈ H be a fixed reference state and Uγ the unitary representing total holonomy accrued
along γ. Define
                               F [γ] = Re ψ0 | Uγ | ψ0 − β −1 S ργ ,
                                                                  
with S(ρ) = − Tr(ρ log ρ) the von Neumann entropy and β = (kB T )−1 . The first term rewards
constructive interference with the reference state, the second penalises informational disorder.
Schelling trajectory.
A loop γ ∗ is a Schelling trajectory iff
                                  F [γ ∗ ] ≥ F [γ ◦ η],    ∀η ∈ π1 (M ).
Thus the set of Schelling loops forms a Nash-equilibrium subgroup under concatenation, re-
flecting the original game-theoretic intuition (players choose focal points that are mutually pre-
dictable without communication).
Metrological precision.
For N independent traversals of a Schelling loop with correlated branch labels, the quantum
Fisher information scales as F ∼ N 2 owing to coherent accumulation of phase. The Cramér–Rao
bound then gives
                                                 1     1
                                      Var(θ̂) ≥    ∼ 2,
                                                 F    N
surpassing the standard Heisenberg limit (1/N ) and thereby achieving the advertised “super-Turing”—i.e.
supra-Heisenberg—scaling.
7     Conceptual Implications and Energetics
The device operates as a multiversal interferometer : what would require macroscopic path-lengths
(∼ 1029 ly) in single-branch spacetime can be realised by topologically equivalent branch cycles.
Kipping’s anthropic Bayesian prior,
                                       P (λ) ∝ eα m(λ) ,     α > 0,
weights mature branches (large m) exponentially, biasing holonomy-mediated information flow
towards history lines rich in free energy. The architecture therefore unifies computation (logical
braids), sensing (holonomy spectroscopy), and energy harvesting (vacuum-energy differentials)
on a common topological substrate.
