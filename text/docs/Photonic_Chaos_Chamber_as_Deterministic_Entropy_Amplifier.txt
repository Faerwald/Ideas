Photonic Chaos Chamber as Deterministic Entropy Amplifier
A two–dimensional stadium cavity with ideal mirrors forms an Anosov system. Let M0 denote its
bounce map with Lyapunov exponent λ > 0. External “bubble” kicks of magnitude δθn = 10−9 rad bn
(bn ∈ {−1, +1}) expand to detector scale after ∆n ≈ λ−1 ln(π/r). Logging the first–return cell indices
km produces an incompressible bit-stream for unbiased {bn }; bias reduces its Kolmogorov complexity,
so the chamber serves simultaneously as a chaos-based RNG and bias meter.
Ghost-Coupled Branch Phase-Locking
Branches are modelled as oscillators ψi = Ai eiϕi with ϕ̇i = ω0 + ξi (t). A ghost-sector interaction H =
P          †                  ˙
  i<j βij Gi Gj + h.c. yields ∆ij = −κij sin ∆ij + ηij where κij = 2|βij |Ai Aj /ℏ. If κij > γdecoh , off-diagonal
coherence revives, allowing single-qubit information exchange across branches; neural quantum scars
enlarge Ai , making κij tunable via chaos control.
Hénon Map as Likelihood-Ratio Detector
                                                          
For the perturbed map Fε (x, y) = 1 − ax2 + y + εbn , bx with |a| > 1, 0 < |b| < 1, collision radii
r ≤ 10−12 and cluster windows ∆t ≤ 10−6 s set the null-hypothesis anomaly rate below 10−30 s−1 . Any
observed anomaly delivers > 100dB evidence of bias in {bn }.
Debug vs. Audit Parameter Sets
 Parameter          Debug Audit
 Collision radius r  10−3 ≤ 10−12
 Cluster window ∆t 10−2 s ≤ 10−6 s
   Hard-coded compilation flags forbid switching between regimes at run time.
p-Adic Tree–Aligned FFT
                       Q
With square-free N = N j pj , reorder indices by weight w(n1 , . . . , ns ) = n1 + p1 n2 + p1 p2 n3 + . . . .
The DFT factorises as     j Wpj acting on contiguous blocks, eliminating global shuffles and enabling
single-pass GPU kernels that hit the roof-line performance bound.
Recursive p-Adic Temporal Steering
Start with S0 = a0 at event t0 . Nightly updates add ak pk selected by a loss Lk , giving Sk = Sk−1 + ak pk .
In chaotic life dynamics ṡ = F (s) + G(Sk ), ∂s(t)/∂ak ∝ eλ(t−t0 ) p−k , so deep digits steer long-term
futures at tiny present cost.
Grammar as Gauge Symmetry
A language L with grammar group G forms gauge fibres O(s) = {g · s | g ∈ G}. Meaning is an
invariant functional µ : L/G → M. Ambiguity keeps s superposed over O(s) until future context fixes
µ; embedding L into Qp supplies an ultrametric for rapid convergence to semantic attractors.

Boundary-Driven Amplitude Steering
For a cavity length L(t) = L0 + δL sin Ωt, the dynamical Casimir rate is Γ ≈ Ω4 (δL)2 /[192πcL20 ].
Post-selecting a rare outcome of prior probability p⋆ ≪ 1 boosts the corresponding path amplitude by
1/p⋆ while respecting unitarity. Cryptographic timestamps preserve an immutable audit log.
Cost-Optimal 80dB Faraday Capsule
                                                                                 p
Sheet thickness requirement for minimum frequency fmin and resistivity ρ is t ≥ 3 2ρ/(µ0 2πfmin ).
Steel at fmin = 10kHz demands t ≈ 1mm; a 60 µm Ag/Cu inner liner adds ∼ 20dB at GHz, meeting
≥ 80dB shielding for a 20L, < 15kg capsule.
EEG-Gated Entropy Bias Injection
Sample 16-channel EEG at 250Hz; band-pass 8–12Hz       L and(m)30–45Hz. Bubble polarity every ∆t = 4ms is
bn = sign(∂t ϕc ). XOR across M participants: bn = m bn . Mutual information I({b(m) }; anomaly) >
0 reveals statistically significant inter-brain correlation influencing the chaotic anomaly detector.
