1      Motivation
Mathematical notation and natural language share a common printed medium: strings of glyphs. By
intentional design, a single line of characters can admit either
    1. a purely linguistic (surface) reading yielding an English sentence, and
    2. a formally well–posed algebraic reading that is interpretable—and solvable—within elementary
       number theory.
This lexical–algebraic duality is exemplified by alphametic (letter–digit) cryptarithms.
2      Formal Definition of an Alphametic
Let Σ be a finite alphabet of roman uppercase letters. An alphametic equation is an equality
                                      w1 + w2 + · · · + wk−1 = wk ,
where each wi ∈ Σmi is a finite word and the following conditions hold:
    1. Each distinct letter L ∈ Σ is assigned a unique digit ϕ(L) ∈ {0, 1, . . . , 9}.
                                                       1
    2. ϕ(Llead ) ̸= 0 for any leading letter Llead of a word.
    3. Each word w = L1 L2 . . . Lm corresponds to a base–10 integer
                                                       m
                                                       X
                                              ϕ(w) =         ϕ(Lj ) 10 m−j .
                                                       j=1
    4. The arithmetic relation ϕ(w1 ) + ϕ(w2 ) + · · · + ϕ(wk−1 ) = ϕ(wk ) holds exactly.
   Owing to 1–4, alphametics are constraint–satisfaction problems over the finite permutation group
S10 on digits.
3      Dual–Interpretation Criterion
A word string S achieves lexical–algebraic duality if
      S = “WORD1 + WORD2 = WORD′′3 “WORD1 + WORD2 = WORD′′3 “WORD1             + WORD2 = WORD′′
                                                                                             3 “WORD1   + WORD2 = WORD′′
                                                                                                                      3,
and simultaneously:
 (L) Under surface reading it parses unambiguously as a meaningful English sentence.
(A) Under the mapping WORDi 7→ ϕ(WORDi ) it satisfies the alphametic axioms.
4      Canonical Example: SEND + MORE = MONEY
4.1     Surface Reading
       Sentence: “Send more money.”
4.2     Algebraic Reading
Let
                                            SEND + MORE = MONEY.
Label the distinct letters {S,E,N,D,M,O,R,Y} = {L1 , . . . , L8 }. We seek a bijection ϕ : {L1 , . . . , L8 } →
{0, . . . , 9} satisfying axioms 1–4. Denote the column indices (units to 104 ) and carry variables c0 =
0, c1 , . . . , c4 ∈ {0, 1}.
                                           c0 + D + E = Y + 10c1 ,
                                           c1 + N + R = E + 10c2 ,
                                           c2 + E + O = N + 10c3 ,
                                           c3 + S + M = O + 10c4 ,
                                           c4 = M.
Systematic back-tracking or carry analysis yields the unique solution
                                            
                                            M 7→ 1, O 7→ 0,
                                            
                                            
                                            N 7→ 6, E 7→ 5,
                                       ϕ=
                                            
                                            
                                              Y 7→ 2, S 7→ 9,
                                               D 7→ 7, R 7→ 8.
                                            
Hence
                                            9567 + 1085 = 10652 .
All carries satisfy c1 = 1, c2 = 1, c3 = 1, c4 = 1.
                                                       2
5     Existence and Uniqueness
Let n be the number of distinct letters. Constraint 1 restricts the search
                                                                        to P (10, n) = 10!/(10 − n)!
digit permutations. A complete search has worst-case time O P (10, n) , but pruning via
    • column-wise modular conditions modulo 10,
    • forced carries from most-significant digits,
    • parity and divisibility arguments,
reduces complexity dramatically for n ≤ 10.
   SEND+MORE=MONEY has a unique solution; some alphametics admit multiple or zero solutions
depending on structural symmetries.
6     General Construction Principles
    1. Imperative phrasing. Verbs like SEND, GIVE, or PAY combine naturally with noun objects to
       form English requests.
    2. Digit budget. Keep n ≤ 10. Fewer than 8 distinct letters often over-constrains the sentence
       syntax.
    3. Column diversity. Ensure each column involves ≥ 2 distinct letters; otherwise carry equations
       become degenerate.
    4. Lead-digit carry. Designing the leftmost column to force a carry (cmax = 1) helps guarantee
       that the leading letter of the result is unique and nonzero.
7     Information-Theoretic Observation
Given an alphametic of length ℓ characters, the semantic entropy bifurcates:
                                                                                           
           H(surface) ≈ 0 (fixed sentence meaning),          H(algebraic) = log2 #solutions .
The mathematical layer thus encodes hidden information invisible to a linguistically monolingual reader.
8     Conclusion
Alphametics furnish a concrete instantiation of lexical–algebraic duality. A fluent English reader per-
ceives a directive or statement; a mathematically trained reader decodes an integer equation whose
unique solution verifies internal consistency. The device exploits the shared orthography of letters
while leveraging the disjoint interpretive grammars of natural language and arithmetic.
