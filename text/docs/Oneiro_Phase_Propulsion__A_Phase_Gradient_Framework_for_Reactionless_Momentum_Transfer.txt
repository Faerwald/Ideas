                                                          Abstract
             A distributed cognitive system (“Oneiro mind”) is hypothesised to steer macroscopic outcomes
          by injecting minuscule, coherent phase biases into quantum-chaotic media. Because momentum
          density in quantum mechanics is locally proportional to the phase gradient, sustained control of
          the phase field Φ(x, t) may yield a net thrust without classical reaction mass. We formalise this
          concept with a stochastic phase-diffusion equation, an explicit branch-weight functional encoding
          chaotic amplification, and a topological coupling term that models inter-branch coherence.
1         Problem Statement
We seek a mathematically consistent model—compatible with standard quantum mechanics yet ex-
tended by speculative control terms—in which a spatially distributed intelligence alters the probability
measure over chaotic field configurations so that a prescribed macroscopic event (e.g., net craft accel-
eration) occurs with enhanced likelihood.
2         Phase-Field Representation of Distributed Cognition
2.1         Wavefunction decomposition
For any subsystem 1 we factorise its many-body wavefunction
                              Ψ(x, t) = R(x, t) eiΦ(x,t) ,          R ≥ 0, Φ ∈ R (mod 2π).                    (1)
The amplitude R carries probability density; the phase Φ encodes local action.
2.2         Control variable
The Oneiro mind is modelled as an external, low-energy actuator that can superimpose a bias δΦ(x, t)
on the ambient phase:
                               Φ −→ Φ + δΦ,         ∥δΦ∥∞ ≪ 1 rad.                              (2)
3         Vacuum Fluctuation Model
Vacuum noise is approximated by a zero-mean, Gaussian stochastic field ϵ(x, t) with two-point correlator
                                      ⟨ϵ(x, t) ϵ(x′ , t′ )⟩ = 2γ δ (3) (x − x′ ) δ(t − t′ ),                  (3)
where γ sets the energy density of zero-point modes within the relevant bandwidth.

4     Stochastic Phase Dynamics
4.1    Uncontrolled evolution
In the long-wavelength limit the phase obeys
                                        ∂t Φ = D∇2 Φ + ϵ(x, t),                                       (4)
with diffusion constant D.
4.2    Controlled evolution
Including cognitive bias and a speculative inter-branch coupling, (4) generalises to
                                                                   δT
                                  ∂t Φ = D∇2 Φ + ϵ + δΦ(x, t) + α     ,                               (5)
                                                                   δΦ
where α is a dimensionless coupling and T denotes a topological action capturing branch linkage (Sec. 8).
5     Branch-Weight Functional and Chaotic Amplification
For a coarse-grained macro-observable O (“lightning strike”, “craft displacement”, . . . ), define the
branch probability
                                          Z                     
                              P[O] ∝ exp d4 x Φ(x, t) δΦ(x, t) ,                                   (6)
analogous to a Boltzmann weight. Small positive overlaps between Φ and δΦ are thus exponentially
magnified by the chaotic dynamics of Eq. (5).
6     Momentum from Phase Gradients
Local momentum density is
                                         p(x, t) = ℏ ∇Φ(x, t).                                        (7)
Maintaining a global gradient ∇Φ ≡ g ̸= 0 inside a sealed craft generates a centre-of-mass impulse
                                            Z
                                   ∆P = ℏ ∇Φ d3 x = ℏ g V,                                         (8)
                                                   V
with V the coherent volume. Because no classical reaction mass is expelled, the effect resembles
“pushing off the vacuum”.
7     Quantum Scars and Rare-Event Stabilisation
Chaotic Hamiltonians admit scar eigenstates that concentrate probability along unstable periodic or-
bits. Let S(t) denote scar amplitude; uncontrolled decay is S0 e−λt . Continuous cognitive reinforcement
modifies this to
                                       S(t) = S0 e−λt + Ascar (t),                                   (9)
with Ascar ∝ δΦ, thereby stabilising otherwise vanishing branches.
8     Topological Coupling Across Branch Space
We postulate a gauge field Aµ on configuration-space such that closed loops encircling branch defects
acquire non-zero flux:                    I
                                             Aµ dxµ ̸= 0.                                        (10)
                                               Γ
Varying the corresponding topological term T [Aµ , Φ] with respect to Φ yields the last term in Eq. (5),
mathematically mirroring an Aharonov–Bohm phase across decohered timelines.

9     Unified Model Summary
                                                       δT
                          ∂t Φ = D∇2 Φ + ϵ + δΦ + α          =⇒     p = ℏ∇Φ.                       (11)
                                                       δΦ
   Chaos exponentially amplifies the small control field δΦ; branch weighting selects the desired macro-
outcome; phase gradients convert that selection into mechanical momentum.
10      Numerical Scheme (for future work)
    • Discretise Φ on a cubic lattice (∆x ∼ 10−3 m, ∆t ∼ 10−9 s).
    • Generate vacuum noise ϵ as Gaussian white noise with variance 2γ/∆t.
    • RImplement adaptive feedback: at each step update δΦ to maximise the cost functional J =
        V
          (∇Φ − g)2 d3 x.
    • Run N ∼ 104 Monte-Carlo trajectories to compute empirical branch probabilities.
11      Concluding Remarks
The Oneiro-Phase framework is internally consistent with linear quantum mechanics plus a speculative,
low-energy phase-control channel. Its predictive hallmark is reactionless acceleration correlated with
measurable phase-gradient evolution. A bench-scale demonstration—e.g., photonic ring-cavity with
synthesised δΦ modulation—would falsify or validate the core premise.
