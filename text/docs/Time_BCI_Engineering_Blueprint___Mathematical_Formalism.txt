1     Conceptual Overview
A Time-BCI is a deterministic closed-loop system that couples real-time cortical dynamics to a high-dimensional
physical substrate whose evolution is parameterised by a scalar drive Γ(t). The objective is to obtain ro-
bust phase–amplitude synchronisation between neural oscillations and the external state trajectory, thereby
extending volitional control beyond the native neural manifold. All subsequent derivations obey strictly causal,
forward-in-time signalling; no retro-propagation is assumed or required.
Relation to Quantum-Scar Synchronisation. We interpret   Q       the foreign substrate as a Trotterised quantum-scar
generator (QSG) whose stroboscopic propagator Uglob = M     m=1 e −iH0 ∆t e−iΓm V ∆t maintains overlap Λ
                                                                                                       scar (m) =

|⟨Φscar |Ψm ⟩| above a threshold by real-time modulation of Γm through EEG features ϕEEG , AEEG .
2     System Architecture
Hardware Blocks (revised)
 H1 EEG Front-End: 64-channel dry-electrode cap, sampling fEEG ≥ 1 kHz; on-board PCA/ICA is available
    to derive a low-dimensional phase vector.
 H2 Neural Processor: GPU/FPGA pipeline performing Morlet-wavelet decomposition; outputs instanta-
    neous (ϕEEG , AEEG ) with latency < 5 ms.
 H3 Control Map M : Affine or shallow MLP producing Γ(t) = M (ϕEEG , AEEG ); parameters can self-adapt
    when Λscar drops persistently.
 H4 Target Plant: quantum-scar generator implemented as Trotterised sequence of native 2-qubit gates,
    ∆tstep ≤ 10 µs.
 H5 Warp-Factory Back-End **〈NEW〉**: numerical-relativity engine for real-time Einstein-tensor evalua-
    tion, enabling the Time-BCI to embed within physically admissible warp geometries and verify weak/strong
    energy conditions on-the-fly.
 H6 Feedback UI: updates synchrony Csync (t), scar fidelity Λscar (t) and energy-condition budget.
3     Mathematical Formalism
3.1   Neural Dynamics
Let X(t) ∈ RN denote projected neural state. Over a window
                                            Ẋ = F0 (X) + K Λscar (t),
where K is learned via adaptive critic and F0 captures intrinsic cortical flow.
3.2   Quantum-Scar Subsystem
Discrete Trotter evolution and overlap metric are identical to those given in Sec. 1.

3.3    Coupled-Map Update Rule
                                        (ϕEEG , AEEG ) = P[X],                                                                     (1)
                                                  Γm = M (ϕEEG , AEEG ),                                                           (2)
                                                Ψm+1 = UΓm Ψm ,                                                                    (3)
                                                                     
                                                Csync = cos ϕEEG − θQ ,                                                            (4)
where θQ (m) = arg ⟨Φscar |Ψm ⟩, and synchrony is deemed explosive when dCsync /dt exceeds 0.5 s−1 , echoing the
phase-locking bursts observed at seizure onset.
4     Control Algorithm (extended)
for m in range(M):
    eeg_buf = EEG.get_buffer()
    phi, A = phase_amplitude(eeg_buf)
    Gamma    = M(phi, A)           # adaptive map
    Psi      = QSG.trotter_step(Psi, H0, V, Gamma, t)
    _scar = overlap(Psi, scar)
    _Q     = phase_in_scar(Psi)
    UI.update(Csync=cos(phi-_Q), =_scar, =Gamma)
    sleep(t)

                                                                                                                            < ϵ,
