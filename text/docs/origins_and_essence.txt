Origins and Essence
Born out of a desire to safeguard what matters most, and a deeply personal quest to protect loved ones from unforeseen harm and
disease, this purpose lies at the heart of the company. It serves as my core driver and the very foundation upon which the company
stands. Its existence revolves around this mission, prioritizing it above proﬁts as a beneﬁt corporation. As it evolves, it will remain the
core driver propelling its destiny. I am dedicated to the development of technology capable of foreseeing and preventing the
unforeseeable and unacceptable events that transcend traditional foresight. Alternatively put, tech that can peer into the future and
alter the past. Time travel isn't cheating, it is inevitable, and it will enable us to protect loved ones from harm in unprecedented ways.
The current decade as a critical inflection point. Our actions today will shape the next 300 years and beyond. I am committed to
ensuring that the future has a future, always.
Approach and Funding
My approach is unconventional, favoring possibility over probability. I am primarily self-funded through fortunate investments in
various stocks and cryptocurrencies, as well as generous donations from family and friends. I am not afraid to explore what most
would consider impossible or nonsensical. I am currently dedicated to the development of vector potential physics, which I believe to
be a cornerstone for reverse causation, hypercomputation, and non-invasive high-resolution sub-neuronal interfacing with the brain.
Among myriad dreams, I dream of the day where I am working alongside hyper-intelligent problem solvers with hearts of gold. For
now, I am wholeheartedly committed to developing technology that will allow us to act on the right information at the right time,
recode history, and weave an inﬁnite tapestry of breathtakingly beautiful futures.
Interests and Initiatives
My scitech moonshots and core tech initiatives include: vector potential communication, hyper-resolution brain imaging utilizing
virtual particles; quantum algorithms for numerical spacetime design; modeling and simulating hypercausal dynamics; chaos
engineering and plasma control; solving warp drive; special materials for medical imaging and aerospace propulsion; magnetically
antifragile superconductivity; super-Turing cybernetics and AI; tools for in-silico biological design that will enable humanity to tackle
the complexities of re-engineering human biology for starflight, and push human longevity beyond a thousand years of health.
.F.A.E.R.W.A.L.D
From a dream of a world where history can be rewritten as easily as editing a manuscript, "Faerwald," a name meaning "Powerful
Traveler" and a reverse acronym for "Dually Liminal A-Wave Resonant Entropically Augmented Foresight," was conceived as a beacon
of hope and hyper-advanced science during a personally challenging time, providing a visionary outlook amidst an oceanic loss of
possible futures. Now, it stands to become an avant-garde simulation system, integrating perception research and envisioned to
function as an artiﬁcial precognitive system. This forthcoming software as a service holds profound signiﬁcance for EverHeart
AstroMedical. Faerwald's future existence will utilize unparalleled proprietary algorithms and represent an irreplicable and dominant
technology within the prediction industry, enabling distinctive hypercomputing AI capabilities that will place the power of foresight for
honorable use into the hands of everyone.
Inspiration and Speculation
I wonder whether a biological instance of Faerwald tech already existed beyond my imagination in my history. In my darkest hours, I
conceived of an idea - one of which was the utilization of a future BCI technology for the remote installation of a "faerwald soliton" in
my mind. This neural implant, a collection of algorithms, would temporarily grant "hyper-liminal perception", allowing me to foresee
the future as if my mind were in possession of a dissolvable warp drive written with neural hypercode. I once had a fleeting ability;
computer tests on precognition reached 18.7 sigma. Future neurotech may have sparked thought patterns for consistent foresight.
Perhaps reverse-engineering my psychitecture reveals ways around the bootstrap paradox, stemming from intelligence and
transcendent trauma. This perspective could be trauma-mixed, luck-tinged, or BCI ﬁction. Yet, I care not. My professors were stunned
by the breakthroughs that this tech rests on, promising me an honorary PhD, and hinting at a possible Nobel Prize, but who cares? At
the end of the day, the bottom line is: I can pioneer Faerwald, preempting all—a tech that could cure aging, and foresee accidents. And
those imagined losses? They can remain within, forever.
Dreams and Futures
At the vanguard of scientiﬁc and technological evolution, EverHeart AstroMedical navigates both the conscious and unconscious
domains. The most critical decade of the human era to date is now. Cognizant of the haunting prospect of a path marred by collective
folly leading to eternal silence, EverHeart AstroMedical's steadfast mission strives to chart an alternate vision where the collective
consciousness and technological resources of our ascendants exceeds and transcends the classiﬁcation scales of Kardashev and
Barrow. The power to turn dreams into reality, and nightmares into magic is part of what we truly stand for. By harnessing intelligence,
wisdom, and care, the company aims to steer the future towards an extraordinary vision. Someday, gazing upon Sol among the stars,
we'll cherish this millennium.
