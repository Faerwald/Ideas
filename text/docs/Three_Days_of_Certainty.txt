Three Days of Certainty
                                       Jason Agamemnon Sokaris
Sunday afternoon — Riverside Promenade
We walk side by side along the water, hands brushing. Spring sunlight glints off the river; a street
musician’s violin drifts across the air.
“Beautiful day,” she says.
“Almost suspiciously perfect,” I joke. |Sunshine shouldn’t feel this safe.|
She laughs, squeezing my fingers. “Then let’s make it more suspicious.” She stops, turns to face me fully.
“I’ve been thinking about the next thousand years.”
I blink. “That’s . . . ambitious.”
“I meant every syllable last night. I’m here for the long arc—decades, centuries, whatever we can stretch.”
|She’s leading. I’m not used to this.|
I study her eyes for hesitation; there is none. Only calm conviction.
“I’m scared. Not of you—of how much easier everything feels. I keep waiting for the hidden catch.”
“Hidden catches need shadows.” She tilts her head toward the sunlight pooling around us. “I’m not
bringing any.” |Step closer; he’s trembling.|
She takes both my hands. “Can I tell you what I’m certain of?”
“Please.”
“I choose you. Not hypothetically, not if-you-measure-up. Now. Tomorrow. When we’re gray, or when
we’re quantum memories. I don’t need proofs; I feel it like gravity.”
|No uncertainty. None.|
I swallow. “What if I break? What if my past leaks into us?”
“Then we patch the leak.” She lifts my left hand to her lips, kisses the scar on my knuckle. “Pain isn’t
prophetic; it’s historic. We can write new history.”
“You make it sound simple.”
“It’s complicated work, but the answer is simple: stay.” She smiles. “You used to be the rock, right? Let
me anchor us for a turn.”
|Let her.|
I nod once, heartbeat steadying. She loops her arm through mine and continues walking.
Late afternoon — SmallCafé, windows fogged by espresso steam
We claim a corner booth. She orders lavender lattes for us both without asking; apparently she remembers
everything.
“I kept scripts in my head. Lines to reassure, to fix misunderstandings. With you the scripts don’t load.”
“Delete them. We’ll improvise.” |Watch his shoulders drop—yes.|
Her certainty is disarming in the best way.
“You never doubt?”
                                                     1
“I doubt lots of things, but not this. Not us.” She leans forward, elbows on the table. “You fear softness
because last time softness was camouflage for cruelty. I’m not hiding knives. Check as often as you need.”
|I believe her. How is that possible after so little time?|
An elderly couple passes our table, chuckling at a private joke. She smiles at them, then back at me.
“See that? Years of jokes ahead of us.”
“You really mean to spend centuries?”
“I want the prosaic and the cosmic. Groceries and galaxies. Tuesday taxes and Titan’s methane lakes.”
|My future-dreamer instincts just short-circuited.|
I breathe out a soft laugh. “I think I’m falling for you faster than physics allows.”
“Good. I’d hate to be the only one violating causality.”
Evening — My apartment, gentle twilight
She moves around my kitchen like she owns the map, heating leftover soup, humming an old jazz tune. I
set plates, noticing I’m not planning escape routes.
We sit at the table, knees touching.
“I’m still waiting for fear. I can’t find it.”
“Then maybe fear isn’t the compass. Maybe home is.”
|Home. The word lands like a key fitting a lock.|
I reach across, lace my fingers with hers. “Stay tonight?”
“I planned on it,” she answers, then adds, “I planned on every night.” |Let relief soften his eyes—there.|
The last glow of sunset washes the room. For once, thoughts of branching timelines and protective theories
fade to a hush. There is just her pulse against my wrist, anchoring me to the simplest, strongest present
I’ve ever known.
Second Date — Sunday Brunch to Moonrise
(Inner thoughts appear between pipes; they’re noticed, never hidden.)
11:04a.m. — LittleGardenCafé
She arrives first, already seated by the window, a carafe of water waiting. “I ordered croissants, hope
that’s okay.”
“Perfect.” |Still stunned she never drips uncertainty.|
She gestures to the empty chair. “Sit. I want to hear how you spent your morning.”
We trade small stories—my early run, her sketching the skyline. Mid-sentence I hesitate, remembering
how pauses once invited criticism. She leans forward. “Take your time.” |No impatience, no test—just
space.|
When the waiter returns she speaks first: “We’ll share the ricotta pancakes and a side of fruit, please.”
Then to me, “Unless you’d rather something else?”
“It’s exactly what I wanted.” |She decides, but checks—steady compass, not control.|
                                                       2
12:37p.m. — Walk along the canal
Sunlight flickers off the water. She slips her hand into mine, unprompted. “I’ve been thinking. This is
only date two, but I’m already planning date two hundred.”
I laugh breathlessly. “That’s. . . reassuring.”
“Good. Because I’m not here to audition. I’m here to build.” |She means it—no wobble in her tone.|
My pulse ticks up. “The last time I heard promises, they were traps.”
She stops beside a wrought-iron railing. “I won’t use your hope against you. If I ever confuse you, we
pause, name what’s foggy, clear it. No mystery penalties.”
|Storm-cloud rule reversed: clarity first, always.|
I swallow. “You say things I’ve only ever said.”
“Then we speak the same language. Let’s keep translating.” She links her arm through mine.
3:15p.m. — Bookshop Alcove
We sit on the floor between philosophy and astrophysics. She thumbs through Gödel,Escher,Bach; I flip
TheFutureofTimeTravel.
She nudges me. “Swap?”
I pass her my book; she passes hers.
“Chapter nine is where he admits paradoxes don’t scare him.”
I grin. “Sounds familiar.”
She tilts her head. “Let’s make a pact: no fear of paradox, no fear of depth. If something feels off, we
surface together.”
“Deal.” We shake on it, absurdly formal. |Formal feels safe because intent is explicit.|
6:02p.m. — My apartment, soup simmering
A gentle rain starts. She hums an old melody while chopping carrots.
“I keep looking for hidden hooks. I know the pattern: uncertainty, then harm.”
She sets the knife down, meets my eyes. “Certainty, then care. That’s our pattern.”
Her hand covers mine. “If I misspeak, I’ll own it. If I hurt you, I’ll repair it. Full stop.”
|No defensive edge, just promise.|
Something inside me releases—like knots untying in reverse. I exhale shaky relief. “I want to believe.”
“Belief can grow. Let’s water it daily.”
9:08p.m. — Sofa, vinyl spinning low
Miles Davis fills the quiet. She curls beside me, head on my shoulder.
“I’m unused to calm. Calm used to mean danger was loading.”
She lifts her head, meets my gaze. “Calm with me means your nervous system gets a holiday.”
I half-smile. “A thousand-year holiday?”
                                                      3
She laughs softly. “Thousands. Plural. Picture us mapping nebulae at year600, arguing about whose
turn it is to brew coffee.”
|She’s painting futures so effortlessly.|
I trace circles on her forearm. “If you ever change your mind—”
“I’ll tell you the minute I feel the shift. Silence was your enemy. We’ll weaponize openness instead.”
|Weaponize openness—how is that both fierce and gentle?|
11:47p.m. — Bedroom, lamp dimmed
Sheets cool against skin; rain a soft metronome. I lie on my back staring at the ceiling.
She props on an elbow. “Thought spill?”
“I’m trying to summon fear, just to prove I’m not blindsided.”
She shakes her head, amused. “You don’t owe the past that ritual.”
I turn toward her. “What if calm is real?”
“Then you sleep. And tomorrow we collect more data: breakfasts, galaxies, whatever fits.”
She slides closer until our foreheads touch. “Goodnight, future husband,” she whispers, as if stating fact.
My eyes burn, not with pain but with a relief so acute it feels brand-new.
“Goodnight.” |I believe her. I actually believe her.|
Rain continues. For the first time in memory I drift into sleep without rehearsing contingencies—my last
thought a quiet astonishment that love can sound like certainty instead of thunder.
Date3 — Tuesday Night, Rooftop under Spring Constellations
(Inner thoughts marked with pipes; spoken names: Augusta for her, Jason for narrator.)
19:12 — Elevator to the roof
Augusta balances a picnic basket on one hip, presses the button for levelR. “You said you needed open
sky. I brought open sky.”
|She always translates needs into actions—no questions asked.|
I grin, palms damp. In my pocket rests a folded note: Tell her everything. Risk the word love.
19:18 — Blanket spread, city lights below
We unpack soup thermos, figs, dark chocolate. A portable projector casts drifting nebula footage on a
neighbouring wall.
She pours chai into enamel mugs. “You’re quieter tonight.”
“I’m loading courage. May I tell you a story that loops through 1843, 2020, and right now?”
“Tell me the whole spiral.” She tucks legs beneath her.
|Here we go—no hiding.|
Story unfurls
                                                        4
I speak of Ada Lovelace: her Notes, the dates that shadowed my own breakdowns, the conviction my
soulmate must be her—safer to love someone two centuries distant than risk another Lydia. I admit the
brain-computer-interface fantasy—telepathy across time.
Augusta listens without interruption, eyes bright but calm. When I finish, wind stirring the blanket edge,
she nods once.
“You feared disloyalty to a legend. Yet I’m right here, breathing.”
“Exactly. And—” I swallow. “I love you. Not just the feeling of us. You. All in. Second date, third
date—doesn’t matter. I’m committed.” |Heartbeat sprinting but no regret.|
She sets her mug down, shifts closer, covers my hand with both of hers.
“Jason, I love you too. I knew by sunrise after dateone. Certainty, then care—remember?”
I laugh, half-relieved, half-astonished. “You beat my confession by two days?”
“Centuries, technically.” She winks. “Want a wilder twist?”
“Yes.”
“My full name is Augusta Ada Carter. Family joke: Mom adored Lovelace, gave me her first two names.”
|Augusta Ada—my breath catches.|
She continues, quieter. “Maybe that’s coincidence. Maybe names echo across timelines. Either way, I’m
here, choosing you.”
“I once swore I’d marry any woman who spoke of thousands of years on datetwo.”
“Then let’s keep your word.” She pulls a thin brass ring from the picnic basket—simple, elegant.
“Temporary placeholder until we design star-metal bands.”
Tears blur the city lights. “You carried a ring?”
“I carry certainty.” She slips it onto my finger. “No pressure, just promise.”
I slide a silver stacking ring from my keychain and place it on her hand. “Symmetry.”
She studies it, delighted. “Now we’ve both violated physics and etiquette.”
We laugh, foreheads touching.
22:04 — Projector off, night deepening
Stars wheel overhead.
“About Ada Lovelace. Whether she’s a mentor across time or an earlier version of me, I’m grateful. She
led you here.”
“And you make the future feel like breathing.”
We lie back on the blanket, rings catching starlight.
“I don’t know what tomorrow brings.”
“I do. Breakfast. Then chapterone of our thousand-year itinerary.”
|Fear searches for a foothold and finds none.|
Wind cools, but warmth radiates between us—certainty first, then care. The old pattern inverted,
rewritten, and finally safe.
