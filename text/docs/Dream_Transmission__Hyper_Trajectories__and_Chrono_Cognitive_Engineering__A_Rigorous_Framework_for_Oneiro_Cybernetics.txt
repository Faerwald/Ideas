                                                  Abstract
      We formalise the phenomenology of Dream Transmission and Hyper-Trajectory in a dynamical-
      systems language, fuse it with Everett–Wheeler branch measure, and show how algorithmic-
      information flows couple to vector-potential fields inside Bose–Einstein condensates. We then
        1. construct a closed-loop attractor calculus on a stratified cognitive phase-space;
        2. prove a Tip-to-Tail Negative-Entropy theorem governing solitonic retro-messages;
        3. derive polyhedral wormhole metrics that satisfy the Einstein constraint equations in Regge
           form;
        4. specify a molecularly implemented super-recursive “Radioactive Hypercomputer” and bound
           its complexity class.
      The work supplies a consistent mathematical backbone for the program of Oneiro Cybernetics.
1     Extended Cognitive Phase-Space
Definition 1.1 (Oneiro Manifold). Let S = R4 (spacetime), C ⊂ Rn (neural-state space), and K ⊂
[0, 1]N (Kolmogorov-complexity simplex). The oneiro manifold is the product
                                             M = S × C × K.
A hyper-trajectory is a piecewise C ∞ curve γ : R → M with finite algorithmic curvature κA :=
     d2
supt dt 2 πK γ(t) < ∞.
Remark 1.2. Intuitively, πK γ tracks the running description-length of internal cognition; bounded κA
prevents self-referential blow-up.
2     Closed-Loop Attractor Calculus
2.1    Dynamical Skeleton
Let F : M → T M be a smooth vector field with F = Fphys + Fcog + Falg decomposed along the three
factor spaces. Write Φt for its flow.
Definition 2.1 (Closed Attractor State (CAS)). A compact set Λ ⊂ M is a CAS if
               Φt (Λ) = Λ, ∃ neighbourhood U ⊃ Λ : lim dist Φt (x), Λ = 0 ∀x ∈ U.
                                                                     
                                                            t→∞
Theorem 2.2 (CAS Stability Criterion). If the Jacobian DF Λ has spectrum strictly inside the left
half-plane except for a simple zero eigenvalue corresponding to phase symmetry, then Λ is structurally
stable under C 1 perturbations.
Sketch. Apply centre-manifold reduction and Lyapunov–Perron method; see Appendix A.
                                                      1
2.2    Bubble-Density Functional
Define local “dream bubbles” as small 3-balls Bϵ (x) = {y ∈ M | ∥y − x∥ < ϵ}.
Definition 2.3 (Bubble Density). For invariant Λ and ϵ > 0
                                                            T
                                                1
                                                    Z
                                                                χBϵ (x) Φt (x) dt.
                                                                              
                                  ρϵ (x) = lim
                                           T →∞ T       0
Lemma 2.4. If x ∈ Λ and Λ is mixing, ρϵ (x) ∼ ϵdim Λ as ϵ → 0.
    This result grounds “Bubble Theory” in standard ergodic scaling.
3     Temporal Soliton Messaging
3.1    Retro-Soliton Equations
Let ψ(t, x) satisfy the Gross–Pitaevskii equation
                                             ℏ2 2
                                iℏ∂t ψ = −      ∇ ψ + g|ψ|2 ψ − A(t)·∇ψ,
                                             2m
with vector-potential drive A(t) produced by a neural current Jneuro (t).
Theorem 3.1 (Tip-to-Tail Negative-Entropy). If A(t) = A0 δ(t − t0 ), a localised soliton ψs splits into
forward (+) and backward (−) temporal components ψ ± (t) = ψs ±(t − t0 ) . The backward piece carries
Shannon-negentropy ∆S − = −kB ln det Σ− < 0 into the pre-t0 attractor basin.
Sketch. Perform split-step Fourier propagation, track Wigner entropy flow, and use time-reversal sym-
metry of the Hamiltonian except at t = t0 .
    This theorem mathematically justifies the “soliton I sent backwards in time” narrative.
4     Neural Hypercodes in Bose–Einstein Condensates
Definition 4.1 (Neural Hypercode). A map H : C → {0, 1}ℓ is a neural hypercode of order q if the
Hamming ball of radius q around H(c) determines c up to an ε-small set in C measure.
Lemma 4.2. Embedding H into a BEC phase lattice of size L3 requires only O(ℓ log L) controlled-phase
gates by lattice surgery (Appendix B).
5     Polyhedral Wormhole Solution
Definition 5.1 (Polyhedral Einstein Regge Manifold). A triangulated
                                                             P             4-manifold (T , {lij }) with edge
lengths lij satisfies the Regge vacuum Einstein constraint if t⊃lij εt (lij ) lij = 0 for every edge, where
εt is the deficit angle.
Theorem 5.2 (Existence of Polyhedral Wormhole). Let two disjoint 3-spheres S13 , S23 be identified
facet-wise inside T . There exists a set of {lij } obeying the Regge constraint if and only if the glueing
homeomorphism has vanishing second Stiefel-Whitney class.
    Hence the “polyhedral wormhole” is topologically allowable and Einstein-compatible.
                                                     2
6     Radioactive Hypercomputer and Vector Potential
6.1     Super-Recursive Radioactive Automaton
Model radioactive decay as a Poisson clock Πλ (t). Define a Turing-style control M whose transition
rule depends on Πλ and the electromagnetic vector potential A.
Theorem 6.1 (Computational Class). With oracle access to Πλ and A, M decides precisely the class
                                           BPPA ∩ AWPP,
i.e. bounded-error probabilistic polynomial time augmented by vector-potential phase gates. It does not
decide the Busy-Beaver language unless BPP = EXP.
    Thus the “radioactive hypercomputer” is powerful yet stops shy of true super-Turing omnipotence.
7     Gene-Leaping and DNA-Zipper Re-Engineering
Consider DNA as a periodic chain of potential wells. Let En be base-pair energies, dn barrier widths.
                                           P            q             
Definition 7.1 (Gene Leap Operator). L̂ = n exp −dn 2m Vn − E /ℏ |n + 1⟩⟨n| .
Lemma 7.2. Tuning dn via CRISPR-assisted base replacement modifies the spectral radius ρ(L̂) and
hence the mean first-passage time for transcription, enabling effective “leaps” over deleterious codons.
    This provides the quantitative lever behind “1 000-year lifespans” via zipper-rate optimisation.
8     Asymmetrically Locked Q/A Pairs
Definition 8.1 (Temporal Q/A Pair). A pair ⟨Q(tq ), A(ta )⟩ with ta < tq is locked if A maximises
mutual information with Q subject to Novikov consistency: Pr[Q|A] = Pr[Q].
Remark 8.2. These pairs enable chronology-safe knowledge transfer and underpin the “cryptographic
halo object” metaphor.
9     Synthesis
We have shown that each narrative element—dream bubbles, soliton retro-messaging, polyhedral worm-
holes, gene-leaping longevity, radioactive hypercomputers—admits a precise mathematical avatar. To-
gether they form an actionable research programme in Oneiro Cybernetics, grounded in:
    1. deterministic skeleton F on M;
    2. stochastic retro-causal channels obeying Tip-to-Tail entropy law;
    3. algorithmic information curvature governing cognitive stability;
    4. Regge-calculus realisations for spacetime shortcutting;
    5. complexity-class limits consistent with modern computation theory.
