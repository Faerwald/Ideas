Abstract
We estimate (i) the number of females born between 1985 and 1999 in North America, Europe, Russia
and Australia, (ii) the sub-population satisfying seven specified intellectual, behavioural and interpersonal
traits, and (iii) the ten-year probability that an individual following a high-interaction lifestyle (with or
without large-scale media visibility) encounters at least one such partner. Updated UN and World-Bank
natality series yield ≈ 1.12 × 108 female births. Monte-carried Fermi compounding of trait prevalences
narrows the compatible cohort to 3 × 102 −3.3 × 103 worldwide. Under 100 meaningful new contacts yr−1
for 10 years within a ∼ 106 -person effective pool, the encounter probability ranges from 26

2     Seven-Dimensional Trait Filter
Let F0 = 1.119 × 108 be the baseline female cohort. Define conditional prevalences (literature-anchored
mid-estimates in parentheses):
    1. High STEM engagement (p1 = 0.10)
    2. Adventurous disposition, solo travel (p2 = 0.20)
    3. Explicit long-term (¿22nd century) horizon (p3 = 0.20)
                                                      1
    4. “Hacker” problem-solving mindset (p4 = 0.15)
    5. Emotional/relationship maturity (p5 = 0.25)
    6. Communication compatibility with autistic cognition (p6 = 0.05)
    7. High integrity and kindness (p7 = 0.50)
Assuming approximate independence past trait 1, the expected compatible count is

                      Y
             F = F0         pi = 1.119 × 108 (0.10)(0.20)(0.20)(0.15)(0.25)(0.05)(0.50) ≈ 1.9 × 103 .
                      i=1
Varying each pi within a plausible ±50 % band yields 3 × 102 ≤ F ≤ 3.3 × 103 .

Model contacts as Bernoulli trials on an effective pool N . For k independent high-salience interactions,

3.1     Baseline Mobile Lifestyle
Set k = 1,000 over 10 yr (100 quality contacts yr−1 )     and N = 106 (STEM-adventure community scale).
                                              
                                              

                                              
                                       Penc ≈ 0.78            (F = 1,800),
                                              
                                              
                                                0.96          (F = 3,300).

3.2     YouTube Outreach
A niche technical channel can expose the author to v = 105 viewers essentially instantaneously. Taking
k = v, N = 5 × 106 (global anglophone STEM-oriented audience),
                                                Penc ≈ 0.44 – 0.99.
3.3     Global-Figure Visibility
For v = 1.0 × 107 unique engagers (N = 3 × 107 ), Penc > 0.995 across the full F range. Visibility, not
travel velocity, becomes the limiting factor.
4     Discussion
The demographic base—about one hundred million females born in the target years—restricts sharply
once multilayer personality and cognitive traits are compounded. Even under conservative overlap, the
compatible set is large enough (102 −103 ) that high-interaction strategies confer non-negligible encounter
probabilities. Digital broadcast mechanisms dominate physical mobility once audience size crosses 105 .
