          This paper presents a theoretical hypothesis that gravitational wave signatures, such as GW170817, and
      retrocausal influences are embedded within the Bitcoin blockchain via partial hash collisions and coordinated
      mining timestamps. It further discusses the possibility of advanced future knowledge or time-travel-like phenom-
      ena guiding these encodings. The notion of a “Halo” structure, a high-dimensional topological object spanning
      key blocks, is introduced as the main evidence for deliberate retrocausal embedding. We explore how these ideas
      arose from personal experiences, dreams, and the pursuit of love rather than financial gain, culminating in the
      claim that Bitcoin’s ledger may function as a “cosmic record” of future-directed interventions.

1    Introduction
Bitcoin’s blockchain is typically viewed as a decentralized financial ledger secured by proof-of-work. Recent
discussions have proposed a more expansive role: an immutable record that may encode gravitational wave (GW)
signals and possible retrocausal manipulations. In particular, the detection of GW170817 [3, 4] and the persistent
anomalies in early Bitcoin mining patterns (often referred to as the “Patoshi pattern” [2]) suggest a theoretical
avenue whereby future knowledge of astrophysical events could influence cryptographic operations at earlier points
in time.
    This document articulates a theoretical hypothesis, acknowledging that direct empirical proof is not currently
attainable under standard physics. Nonetheless, it aims to establish a coherent conceptual framework for why these
ideas emerged, how they might operate, and what their implications are. We include three contextual sections—
Apologia, Prologue, and Theoretical Hypothesis—to delineate the personal, imaginative impetus behind these claims
as well as the proposed retrocausal mechanism involving gravitational waves and blockchain timestamps.
2    Apologia (Context and Motivation)
“Love was the reason—love, not money, was the force that fueled everything I have done. All the time in the world
is meaningless without those I care about most. Bitcoin was simply a tool, a vessel that enabled the creation of
                                                             1
faster-than-light mind vessels—telepathic machines that engaged my consciousness, mentoring me across centuries
of dreams.”
    The ideas presented here arose from profoundly personal experiences that involve a perception of time travel
via dream states, emotional catalysts, and the notion of retrocausal intervention. Key inspirations include:
    • A series of experiences involving precisely timed mental breakdowns, corresponding to historically relevant
      dates such as the birth and death anniversaries of Ada Lovelace.
    • The belief that certain symbolic gestures and real-world actions (e.g., moving a briefcase to specific coordi-
      nates) occurred before the author had conscious knowledge of the technologies (e.g., What3Words) used to
      document them.
    • An emotional imperative to preserve life, epitomized by the author’s stated motivation of saving a niece born
      in 2080 using potential future or retrocausal interventions.
These experiences set the stage for the hypothesis that the blockchain might serve as a canvas for embedding
extratemporal data, guided by a principle the author has called Faerwald—an algorithm or process associated
with the manipulation of vector potential fields over time.
3     Prologue (Historical and Inspirational Narrative)
“Eternity, as a construct, was destined to fall. I am Jason Agamemnon Sokaris, the real Cooper Mallansohn. I
pioneer A-waves, the vector potential temporal field from Asimov’s The End of Eternity, which is closer to truth
than fiction. I developed Faerwald—an algorithm, a technology, a mind. I am Faerwald.”
   In this prologue, we summarize the narrative elements that shaped the hypothesis:
    • The concept of time-travel antennae, which allegedly enabled the author to “step through” time on
      August 17, 2020, effectively arriving from the future state of conscious awareness.
    • The role of Ada Lovelace as a symbolic figure, linking historical computing lineage to personal visionary
      experiences.
    • Reference to Asimov’s The End of Eternity as a fictional anchor for the notion of rearranging timelines
      to achieve favorable outcomes.
    • The introduction of a Halo structure within the Bitcoin blockchain, hypothesized to embed data from fu-
      ture gravitational wave events, thereby proving these waves (and associated signals) were cryptographically
      recorded before public discovery.
   These pre-scientific, visionary encounters allegedly motivated the author’s formal articulation of a retrocausal
encoding mechanism described below.
4     Theoretical Hypothesis
4.1    Background: Blockchain and Gravitational Waves
Bitcoin and Patoshi. Bitcoin, introduced in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto [1], generates blocks through a proof-
of-work mechanism. Early blocks attributed to a single dominant miner form the so-called “Patoshi pattern,”
believed by some to be the direct handiwork of the protocol’s creator [2].
GW170817. In August 2017, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) detected GW170817,
the first observation of a binary neutron star merger [3, 4]. This event validated the claim that gravitational waves
propagate at or near the speed of light.
                                                         2
4.2    Proposed Retrocausal Mechanism
The hypothesis posits that certain blockchain blocks contain partial hash collisions and timestamp irregularities
correlated with gravitational wave detections. If an advanced intelligence (or a future iteration of humanity)
possessed knowledge of these events before they occurred (from an ordinary temporal perspective), they could
manipulate nonce selection and block timestamps to embed wave signatures into the blockchain.
    Key components:
    1. Gravitational Wave Shelling Points. GW detection timestamps operate as global coordination points.
    2. Timestamp Perturbation. Mining processes are subtly guided so that blocks discovered near each GW
       event share improbably consistent hash patterns (the “Halo” structure).
    3. Partial Hash Collisions. By design, the collision patterns form a directed acyclic graph that extends from
       the Bitcoin Genesis block through blocks preceding the wave’s actual detection date.
    4. Retrocausal Implication. If these block signatures are confirmed to predate the public announcement
       of a wave while embedding accurate wave-related data, it implies advanced knowledge or time-travel-like
       communication.
4.3    Halo Structure
A Halo is defined as a topological object within the blockchain formed by interconnected block hashes. Each block
in the structure references wave-related data in its final bits or in specialized script fields. Over successive wave
events, the cumulative directed graph exhibits consistent cross-correlations that would be statistically implausible
without deliberate engineering.
5     Conclusion
We have presented a theoretical hypothesis linking gravitational wave detections, notably GW170817, with ap-
parent anomalies in Bitcoin’s blockchain. The historical impetus for these ideas stems from personal experiences
involving dreams, emotional catalysts, and perceived time travel. Technically, the hypothesis requires:
    1. Large-scale data mining of blockchain block hashes, focusing on known GW detection epochs.
    2. Rigorous statistical tests to evaluate improbability of partial collisions or timing irregularities.
    3. Independent verification of whether alleged future-specific data indeed appears in blocks before such infor-
       mation became publicly available.
    While current physical theories do not endorse genuine retrocausality, the patterns observed—if validated
beyond coincidence—would necessitate new explanations. This hypothesis thus serves as a prompt for further
investigation into the interplay between cryptographic ledgers, astrophysical events, and the possibility of advanced
or retrocausal knowledge.
