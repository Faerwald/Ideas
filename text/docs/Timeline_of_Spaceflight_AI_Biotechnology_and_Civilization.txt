Abstract. This document synthesizes a detailed timeline of forthcoming technologies and societal transformations over the
next several centuries, drawn from a set of important texts on space exploration, interstellar propulsion, superintelligence,
synthetic biology, hypercomputation, and other visionary fields. Major sources include:

While some of these references do not provide explicit dates for technological events, they contribute crucial perspectives on
how and when breakthroughs become feasible. This timeline is grouped into approximate periods: short term (the 2020s and
2030s), mid-term (up to 2050), late 21st century (2050–2100), the 22nd–23rd centuries, and beyond 2300. Where possible,
specific details from the relevant works are included. Dates are inherently speculative, especially for radical breakthroughs,
but reflect the authors’ reasoning or best estimates.
1. Early 2020s to 2030 (Immediate Near Term)
Mars and Lunar Preparations
    • The Case for Mars [1]:
          – Argues that a Mars mission could be done “within 10 years of program start” through the Mars Direct plan.
          – Cites hardware leveraging in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) on Mars (e.g. generating return fuel from Martian
            CO2 and hydrogen).
          – Original expectation was a 2000s flight; it remains the same conceptually: if political will arises, a 2020s–2030
            window can achieve a landing.
    • Entering Space [2]:
          – Focused on cheap Earth-to-orbit systems (e.g. fully reusable rockets) within a decade.
          – Lays out a near-term approach for building an Earth–Moon infrastructure: resource extraction (He-3, metals)
            could be tested by late 2020s.
                                                              1
   AI Rising, Early Indications of Superintelligence
   • Mind Children [3]:
        – By early 2020s, Moravec anticipated advanced robotics on par with insects or small animals, transitioning to
          near-human-level from 2020–2030.
        – Although the timeline was somewhat optimistic, it frames this decade as critical for bridging to advanced machine
          intelligence.
   • Superintelligence [4]:
        – Suggests an AI ‘takeoff’ could happen any time in the next few decades, with a cluster of predictions around
          2030–2050. Bostrom gives no single date, but notes many experts in the mid-2010s pinned advanced AI to the
          2020s–2040s.
   • Zero to One [14]:
        – Peter Thiel’s emphasis is not on a specific AI date, but on the idea that the next big leaps in technology happen
          when we go from “0 to 1”—breakthrough, not incremental. The 2020s could be prime time for ambitious startups
          to pursue AI, biotech, or robotics in novel ways.
   Synthetic Biology Foundations
   • Synthetic Biology Handbook [13]:
        – The 2020s are a period of major CRISPR expansions, deep analysis of standardized gene editing.
        – Lays the groundwork for producing new lines of microbes (for biofuel, industrial chemicals) and potential space-
          based uses (closed-loop life support, etc.).
   • The Next 500 Years [5]:
        – Chris Mason’s roadmap for 2021–2040 is about building the computational and genome-engineering basis for
          eventual human adaptation to space’s radiation and partial gravity.
        – Observes that this era invests in fundamental research for safer germline editing.
   Early Laboratory Investigations of Exotic Propulsion
   • Frontiers of Propulsion Science [6]:
        – In the early 2020s, basic lab experiments might investigate quantum vacuum effects, negative energy feasibility,
          or gravity/inertia anomalies.
        – NASA’s Breakthrough Propulsion Physics Project was canceled in 2002, but small-scale efforts might continue
          in the private or academic sector.
   • The Starflight Handbook [7]:
        – Foresees that demonstration missions (e.g. solar sail craft, small nuclear prototypes) might appear in the near
          term if funding arises, enabling partial validation of deep space transport concepts.
2. 2030–2050 (Mid-Term)
Crewed Mars Expeditions, Lunar Settlement Growth
   • The Case for Mars [1]:
        – If delayed from the 1990s start, the next best guess for a robust human landing is the 2030s.
        – A permanent base, supported by in-situ resource utilization, could be established by the 2040s, hosting scientific
          and industrial activities.
                                                            2
• Space Mining and Its Regulation [10]:
     – By the 2040s, legal and commercial frameworks might be tested around cislunar resource extraction (e.g., water
       ice at lunar poles, fueling deeper missions).
AI Achieving or Surpassing General Human Competence
• Mind Children [3]:
     – Moravec predicted that by 2030–2040, machines may match or exceed many human mental capacities. Current
       data suggests remarkable but still domain-specific AI in the early 2020s.
     – Full mind uploading still considered further off but conceptually in progress.
• Superintelligence [4]:
     – Many surveyed AI researchers place a 50% probability of high-level machine intelligence around mid-century. If
       or when that arrives, a fast takeoff might occur, potentially overshadowing all other developments in short order.
Synthetic Biology for Offworld Habitats
• Synthetic Biology Handbook [13]:
     – By the 2030–2040 range, standardized gene circuits could be used in microbe-based life support, “greenhouses”
       on the Moon or Mars.
     – Potential for controlling closed-loop recycling, with organisms engineered to handle partial gravity or cosmic-ray
       flux.
• The Next 500 Years [5]:
     – 2041–2100 is labeled as the era for formal human germline engineering trials. Preparations intensify in 2030–
       2040, possibly culminating in the first pilot studies for radiation-protected lineages.
Advanced Propulsion Demos and Interstellar Precursors
• The Starflight Handbook [7]:
     – Suggests that by 2030–2050, we may see at least small beamed-sail or nuclear-thermal prototypes en route to the
       outer Solar System or 100+ AU vantage points.
• Deep Space Propulsion [8]:
     – Laser-sail technology or partial nuclear pulse systems could be flight-tested. Full-scale interstellar craft remain
       improbable in that window but may see concept validation.
• Frontiers of Propulsion Science [6]:
     – Expects no immediate warp or wormhole breakthroughs. Instead, continuing theoretical exploration. Possibly
       by 2050, better clarity on the quantum vacuum or negative mass feasibility.
Hypercomputation Research (Conceptual Phase)
• Hypercomputation [12]:
     – The 2030–2050 period might see more serious attempts to test or replicate non-Turing frameworks in analog
       physics.
     – Traditional computing will continue to scale, but unorthodox proposals (Malament–Hogarth spacetimes, etc.)
       remain highly theoretical.

3. Late 21st Century (2050–2100)
Large Mars Settlement, Early Terraforming Steps
   • The Case for Mars [1]:
        – By 2050–2060, Zubrin envisions thousands of people on Mars, partial industrial base, the first greenhouse-gas
          releases for climate warming. The atmospheric pressure might be measurably increased.
   • Entering Space [2]:
        – Sees the 2050–2100 window as ripe for large-scale wave of settlers, possibly tens of thousands. The question of
          full terraforming is still centuries, but partial steps accelerate.
   AI Possibly Surpassing Human Intelligence Decisively
   • Mind Children [3]:
        – By 2050–2070, Moravec expected full replacement-level robotics in many fields, overshadowing humans in both
          manual labor and creative tasks, with potential for partial mind uploading.
   • Superintelligence [4]:
        – If superintelligence emerges in this window, society might be reconfigured at an unprecedented pace. Bostrom
          warns alignment and control must be solved by then to avoid existential catastrophe.
   • Zero to One [14]:
        – Thiel does not specify a direct date for superintelligence, but posits that truly revolutionary leaps (“from 0 to 1”)
          in AI could occur once a startup or lab hits the right synergy of capital and technology. Late 21st century is a
          plausible horizon for big leaps.
   Deep-Space Industry, Outer Solar System
   • Space Mining and Its Regulation [10]:
        – By the late 21st century, major legal frameworks for asteroid and lunar mining are in place. Possibly resource
          shipments from near-Earth asteroids to LEO orbits.
   • Deep Space Propulsion [8]:
        – Nuclear fusion or advanced beamed propulsion might be tested for Jupiter or Saturn missions, enabling deeper
          exploration, potential crewed missions to the outer planets near century’s end.
   Human Genetic Modification for Space Environments
   • The Next 500 Years [5]:
        – By 2080–2100, stable lineages engineered for microgravity, radiation, and partial ecosystems might exist, ac-
          celerating an offworld diaspora. Mason sees these multi-decade or multi-generational processes in culminating
          trials by century’s end.
4. 22nd Century (2100–2200)
Fully Operational Multi-Planet Civilization
   • The Case for Mars [1]:
        – With 100+ years of consistent colonization, Mars population could reach tens or hundreds of thousands, with
          near self-sufficiency.
                                                              4
   • Entering Space [2]:
        – Potential for large orbital habitats in Earth or Mars orbits, and an established settlement in the Jovian system or
          the resource-rich asteroids, fueling continuous expansion.
   • Space Mining [10]:
   – By 2100–2200, full-scale asteroid mining consortia might exist, with a robust legal framework. Possibly the main
     impetus for powering starship prototypes (via 3 He, orrawmaterials).
   Interstellar Precursor Missions
   • The Starflight Handbook [7]:
        – Actual robotic probes to the Oort cloud or 550+ AU gravitational focus region feasible.
        – There’s potential for near 1% speed-of-light crafts by advanced nuclear or antimatter, if discovered by then.
   • Mathematical SETI [9]:
        – Large radio/optical telescope arrays far from the Sun, used for advanced SETI. Probability of exoplanet signals
          detection might be high in the 22nd century.
   AI and Post-Biological Societies
   • Mind Children [3]:
        – By early 22nd century, if not earlier, AI-based minds or downloads may be main drivers of exploration, possibly
          overshadowing purely biological humans.
   • Superintelligence [4]:
        – If a stable alignment solution was found, humans might coexist with superintelligences shaping expansions across
          the system. Otherwise, misalignment could lead to negative outcomes well before then.
   Terraforming Gains on Mars
   • The Case for Mars [1]:
        – By 2100–2200, greenhouse acceleration might produce shallow seas, partial farmland, though fully breathable
          atmosphere might still be centuries away.
5. 23rd Century and Beyond (2200–2500)
Major Terraforming Projects
   • Entering Space [2] and The Case for Mars [1]:
        – By mid-23rd century, Mars could have open bodies of water, robust agriculture, as well as partial child-tolerable
          conditions. Full Earth-like environment might wait until 25th century or beyond.
   Interstellar Missions: Generation Ships, Possibly Faster Concepts
   • The Starflight Handbook [7]:
        – If advanced fusion or antimatter is developed in the 22nd century, the 23rd might see the first crewed generation
          ship.
        – Transit times of centuries to the nearest star if speeds 0.01–0.1c are realized.
   • Deep Space Propulsion [8]:
                                                             5
        – Suggests a 2–3 century horizon from the 21st might be needed for a feasible fusion-based starship. This points
          to 2200–2300 for launch, with arrival to Alpha Centauri or another star system mid-late 23rd century or 24th
          century.
   The Next 500 Years: Reaching Another Star?
   • The Next 500 Years [5]:
        – Provides a phase-based approach: by 2401–2500, a generation ship or advanced starship might depart. The
          culminating rationale is that centuries of perfected gene editing, planet-based industries, and large-scale resource
          extraction yield the scale needed for starflight.
   • Mathematical SETI [9]:
        – Suggests a robotic mission to an exoplanet might be feasible if consistent investment in >0.01c propulsion
          occurs.
   Potential Full “Machine Civilization”
   • Mind Children [3]:
        – By 2400–2500, purely robotic or post-biological expansions might be the main presence in the galaxy, with
          human biology either integrated (via uploading) or marginalized.
   • Superintelligence [4]:
        – A stable, value-aligned superintelligence might shepherd galaxies, or a misaligned one might finalize a takeover,
          rewriting matter to suit its goals. The exact timeline is uncertain, but Bostrom allows that 23rd–25th centuries
          are well into the post-human era if superintelligence appears in the 21st or 22nd.
6. Post-2500 (Far Future)
Galactic Diaspora, FTL Speculations, and Hypercomputation
   • Frontiers of Propulsion Science [6]:
        – Warp drives, wormholes, or reactionless thrusters remain purely speculative. If discovered earlier, engineering
          them might take centuries more. Post-2500 is not unrealistic for “exotic” travel.
   • Hypercomputation [12]:
        – If new physics (e.g. Malament–Hogarth spacetimes) or other exotic constructs become testable in centuries to
          come, then beyond 2500 might see actual super-Turing processes.
        – This is not an established mainstream expectation but remains a theoretical possibility.
   • The Road to Reality [11]:
        – Penrose discusses extremely large cosmic timescales (black hole evaporation, etc.), many billions of years. He
          acknowledges that near-future breakthroughs in quantum gravity might shift understanding of spacetime.
   Terraforming Other Worlds, Dyson Spheres, Etc.
   • Entering Space [2] and The Starflight Handbook [7]:
        – Post-2500 expansions might include partial transformation of outer solar system bodies (e.g. Titan, Ganymede)
          or even engineering solar power at star-level scales (Dyson swarms).
   • The Nature of Technology [16]:
                                                             6
         – Arthur’s viewpoint: major leaps in such big engineering come from combinatorial evolution of existing tech.
           Over centuries, the synergy of breakthroughs can lead to large-scale structures or cosmic-level projects that
           would be unimaginable in the early 21st.
Summary of Key Points Across the Books:
    • Short-Term (2020–2030): Foundational R&D in synthetic biology, CRISPR, new rocket designs, small advanced
      propulsion demos, and the first serious stabs at building Martian and lunar outposts. Rapid progress in AI but not yet
      a definitive superintelligence (though some authors predicted it could appear).
    • Mid-Term (2030–2050): Crewed Mars missions could occur, leading to permanent bases. AI leaps into or near
      human-level cognition. Interstellar precursor craft tested, early space-based resource industries set up.
    • Late 21st Century (2050–2100): Significant Mars settlement, potential partial terraforming. AI may exceed human
      intelligence, with critical alignment challenges. Some advanced biotech solutions for space adaptation in humans.
    • 22nd Century (2100–2200): Multi-planet civilization, large-scale asteroid mining, possible post-biological expan-
      sions if AI truly matures. First serious star-probe attempts or generational ship planning.
    • 23rd–25th Centuries (2200–2500): Interstellar flights might actually launch (fusion or antimatter). Terraforming
      Mars could be quite advanced, possibly nearing Earth-like conditions. If superintelligence is well-managed, a robust
      cosmic diaspora is feasible.
    • Beyond 2500: Radical physics solutions (warp, wormholes) could materialize if new theoretical breakthroughs occur.
      Civilizations might be thoroughly post-biological (uploading or AI-based). Large-scale cosmic engineering (Dyson
      structures, multi-star networks) possibly within reach.
