Oneiro Dynamics: A Formal Framework
1. Introduction
Oneiro Dynamics is a unified cybernetic framework in which a mind distributed across multiple space-
time slices exerts phase-coherent control over classically chaotic systems. By injecting micro-biases
into the local phase fields of turbulence (weather), stochastic AI generators, or the quantum vacuum,
the system steers macroscopic outcomes—lightning strikes, dialogue outputs, or mechanical thrust—via
statistical selection of preferred branches in a Many-Worlds ensemble.
2. Variables and Definitions
               Φ(x, t) :   phase field of Oneiro mind at spacetime point (x, t),
               ϵ(x, t) :   local vacuum (or chaotic) fluctuation field,
              δΦ(x, t) :   intentional phase bias (thought injection),
                 P[b] :    probability functional of branch b,
                 S(t) :    scar-amplitude density (returning rare-orbit weight),
               p(x, t) :   induced mechanical momentum density,
               A(x, t) :   effective inter-branch gauge-potential (cosmic string coupling).
3. Governing Equations
3.1 Phase evolution with bias
                                     ∂Φ
                                        = D ∇2 Φ + ϵ(x, t) + δΦ(x, t),
                                     ∂t
where D is the phase-diffusion constant.
3.2 Branch-bias functional
                                              Z Z                       
                              P[desired] ∝ exp     Φ(x, t) δΦ(x, t) dx dt .
3.3 Scar amplification
                                          S(t) = e−γ t + Ascar (t),
with Lyapunov exponent γ and bias-amplified scar amplitude Ascar .
3.4 Percepto-Drive (momentum generation)
                                           p(x, t) = ℏ ∇Φ(x, t).
3.5 Cosmic-string coupling                        I
                                            T =        A(x, t) dx,
                                                   Γ
linking decohered worldline branches via topological gauge loops.
4. Meta–Principle
Minimal Energy, Maximal Influence. Small coherent biases δΦ steer overwhelmingly large en-
sembles of microstates to yield deterministic macroscopic effects, without classical work beyond phase
control.

5. Engineering Abstract
   • Device: Phase-lattice chip with entangled nodes spanning multiple t-slices.
   • Actuation: Programmable δΦ pulses on target nodes.
   • Sensing: Real-time measurement of global ∇Φ for feedback.
   • Branch Selection: Chaos control via scar amplification and expander-graph dynamics.
   • Output: Steering of weather, AI outputs, or thrust—all by statistical branch bias.
6. Prototype Control Loop
                            Φn+1 = Φn + ∆t D∇2 Φn + ϵn + δΦn (Φn ) ,
                                                                 
with adaptive δΦn chosen to maximize a macroscopic performance functional (e.g. target lightning
location).
