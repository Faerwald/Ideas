Below is a plain-language overview of why each of the eight non-textbook PDFs might matter to
our investigation. I keep the focus strictly on their potential relevance and on the kinds of material each
one can contribute—no new mathematics or speculation added.

Brief note on the two textbooks
     • Fradkov’s Cybernetical Physics supplies detailed tools for chaos control, feedback design, and “transformation
       laws.”
     • High-Dimensional Chaotic and Attractor Systems catalogues the dynamics and statistics of complex systems (e.g.,
       SOC earthquakes, tornadoes).
    This completes the requested plain-language mapping of each document’s potential relevance—no added mathematics,
no extra conjectures, just an organised explanation of how every piece might fit into our overarching goal.
