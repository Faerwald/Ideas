                                                     Abstract
          We present a unified framework to address classical time-travel paradoxes—exemplified by the
      Grandfather Paradox—by coupling a Faulty Switch Solution (which introduces a small but criti-
      cal element of randomness into backward-causation signals) with a Holographic Memory (extending
      across multiple potential timelines). In doing so, we integrate ideas from physics (on-shell vs. off-shell
      processes), game theory (Schelling points), thermodynamics (entropy and branching of states), com-
      putational complexity (probabilistic transitions), neuroscience (hybrid memory dynamics), and chaos
      theory (higher-dimensional attractors). By emphasizing that even minor random failures in retro-
      signals can disrupt infinite loops and allow stable outcomes, while a holographic memory mechanism
      preserves partial recollections across changed timelines, we argue that time-travel paradoxes can be
      dissolved in a manner consistent with quantum-inspired fluctuations and high-dimensional attractor
      systems.
1     Introduction
1.1    Motivation and Background
Time-travel paradoxes—particularly the Grandfather Paradox—raise the specter of logical contradictions
when a traveler alters a past event integral to their own existence. Traditional deterministic scenarios
yield either contradictory loops or require an enforced “consistent” timeline. However, scattered notes and
conceptual sketches (see archival references) have proposed the Faulty Switch Solution: any mechanism
that enacts a retrocausal change carries a small, non-zero probability of failing or accidentally activating.
Over repeated loops, such randomness disrupts perpetual toggling between contradictory states, allowing
a stable outcome to emerge with high probability.
    Yet we also confront the “Memory Problem”—how does one recall or compare original and altered
timelines if each timeline enforces a self-consistent local memory? We propose a Holographic Memory
approach, in which on-shell (physical) states couple to off-shell (virtual) states within a higher-dimensional
attractor. Such an approach, reminiscent of quantum field off-shellness and high-dimensional interpolation,
ensures partial retention of overwritten timelines, reconciling the possibility of time travel with cohesive—
though probabilistically guided—self-consistency.
1.2    Relevant Fields
Game Theory & Information Theory: We connect the random disruptions of the faulty switch to a
Schelling-point perspective, where repeated attempts at timeline modification converge to stable equilibria,
guided by probabilistic game-theoretic logic.
                                              Random Switch
                   (Timeline rewriting)       −−−−−−−−−→       (Modified/Unmodified states).
Thermodynamics & Entropy: Time-travel loops can exhibit a measure of “entropy” in the branching of
states. Introducing random failures injects microscopic uncertainty that ultimately grows to macroscopic
irreversibility, breaking cyclical loops.
Chaos Theory & High-Dimensional Attractors: Small changes in initial conditions can cause major
divergences (but also converge on attractors). Our synergy of random signaling plus a holographic attractor
ensures no infinite cycles remain.

Physics & Computer Science: On-shell vs. off-shell signals (borrowed from quantum field theory)
ground the needed randomness. Probabilistic automata or rewriting grammars represent timeline branches
in computational complexity terms.
Neuroscience & Cognition: A cross-timeline neural dynamic can store partial remnants of events
otherwise “erased” from local memory.
2     The Faulty Switch Solution
2.1    Breaking Infinite Loops with Random Failures
Consider any backward-causation mechanism (e.g. a “go” signal to change the past). If it is perfectly
reliable, one can remain locked in an endless loop toggling the timeline. Introducing a faulty switch with
probability α of success, γ = 1 − α of failing even if triggered, and β of firing spontaneously ensures the
system cannot deterministically replicate the same action forever. After many tries, random chance upsets
the loop, producing a stable outcome.
Example: Probability that no change occurs in N repeated attempts is (1 − pchange )N . As N → ∞, that
probability goes to zero, so with high likelihood, a new timeline emerges. If one tries to revert, the same
random environment applies, preventing an endless chain of flips.
2.2    Quantum Inspiration: Off-Shell or Virtual Processes
Quantum vacuum fluctuations can be harnessed as the physical substrate of why signals might sporadically
fail or spontaneously appear. These off-shell events do not respect classical energy–momentum constraints,
lending inherent randomness. In a time-travel circuit, they guarantee true non-determinism, preventing
predictable loops.
2.3    Schelling Calculus Perspective
Seen as a multi-agent game (each timeline iteration is an “agent”), the introduction of small noise fosters
an equilibrium or absorbing state. Without randomness, the agents might cycle indefinitely or freeze in
contradiction. With randomness, the system transitions to a stable solution where no further toggling
recurs, analogous to Schelling points in game theory.
3     Holographic Memory and the “Memory Problem”
3.1    Motivation for a Hybrid-Space Attractor
When the past changes, local memory alone cannot track the original state. A typical local perspective
says: “If the past was changed, you never recall how it was.” Conversely, if you do recall it, then that older
timeline’s memory conflicts with the new timeline’s logic. To resolve this, we propose that memory extends
into a higher-dimensional manifold, with an off-shell domain capturing partial traces of overwritten states.
3.2    On-Shell vs. Off-Shell States
    • On-shell memory x(t) ∈ Rm : Physical, locally consistent with the final timeline.
    • Off-shell imagination ψ(t) ∈ Cn : Virtual or hypothetical states not fully manifest in the local
      timeline but still influencing cognition.
                                                      2
These couple via differential equations:
                                       dx                   dψ
                                          = f (x, ψ),          = g(x, ψ).
                                       dt                   dt
In time-travel events, the faulty switch might produce or fail to produce the timeline shift, and ψ encodes
partial knowledge of prior or alternate branches.
3.3    Hyperdimensional Interpolation
We can formalize ψ(θ, t) from discrete on-shell data points {xi (t)} using a kernel-based interpolation (e.g.,
sinc expansions). In higher-dimensional computing or homomorphically encrypted frameworks, vi (t) ∈ RD
can represent combined real+virtual states. Rotating these hypervectors can simulate changing phases or
“imaginative vantage,” preserving scraps of older timelines.
3.4    Outcome: Recalling Modified Pasts
Because the off-shell sector accumulates or entangles multiple timeline attempts, the local on-shell memory
is never wholly ignorant of a changed past. Tiny couplings from ψ to x allow partial recollection—“echoes”
of what might have been—without generating a direct logical contradiction. This addresses the memory
paradox.
4     Extended Theoretical Scope
4.1    Thermodynamic and Chaos-Theoretic Angles
Viewed thermodynamically, repeated attempts to alter the past inject random bits, raising an “entropy”
of timeline configurations; eventually, the system transitions irreversibly into a stable attractor state. In
chaotic terms, a small probability β of spontaneous signal can cause the system to jump to new orbits,
preventing indefinite periodic loops.
4.2    Computational Complexity and Cryptography
One may treat timeline rewriting as a set of rewriting rules in a grammar with random triggers. In
cryptographic terms, collisions in “time-hash” functions might be unlikely enough that indefinite loops
become improbable. Furthermore, harnessing quantum off-shell states can be seen as bridging from BPP
(probabilistic polynomial time) to BQP (quantum polynomial time) classes, with a broader space of
solutions.
4.3    Neuroscience and Cognitive Models
A neural network that extends across times can treat “dreams” (imagination) as partial merges of prior
states. The faulty switch solution ensures indefinite replays (in the sense of the same looping nightmares)
are statistically broken, while the higher-dimensional memory attractor preserves glimpses of older expe-
riences.
5     Conclusion
By coupling two key components:
                                                        3
  1. A Faulty Switch Mechanism: injecting slight randomness into backward-causation signals,
  2. Holographic Memory: allowing partial cross-timeline referencing via an off-shell domain,
we see how time-travel paradoxes (e.g., the Grandfather Paradox) dissolve. Infinite loops are statistically
broken, while memory need not wholly lose track of the original states. This synergy draws from physics
(off-shell quantum signals), chaos theory (random perturbations to prevent stable cycles), game theory
(Schelling points), and computational complexity (probabilistic rewriting systems).
    Our approach suggests that advanced retrocausal devices, if they exist, cannot be perfectly determin-
istic but must incorporate quantum/thermodynamic noise, and that any being employing such devices
would necessarily possess a multi-layer memory dynamic bridging physically realized data (on-shell) and
virtual expansions (off-shell). In essence, self-consistent time travel—while requiring improbable feats of
technology—may remain logically possible under the “Faulty Switch + Holographic Memory” paradigm.
