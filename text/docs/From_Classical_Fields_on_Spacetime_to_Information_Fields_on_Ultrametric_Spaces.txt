                                                  Abstract
           This monograph expands, formalises, and contextualises the complete sequence of ideas dis-
       cussed in our conversation. Starting from the textbook notion of a field as a function on space-
       time, we generalise the concept to arbitrary base spaces—including symbolic configuration spaces,
       graphs, and p-adic (ultrametric) manifolds—while meticulously defining every mathematical object
       used. We then introduce Schelling information, attractor density, and an information-theoretic
       field interpretation that unifies recurrence, coordination, and cognitive focal points. All back-
       ground material is supplied so that a reader with no specialised prior exposure can follow the
       development from first principles.
1      Classical Field Theory in Minimal Terms
1.1     Standard Definition
Let M denote a smooth 4-dimensional Lorentzian manifold (“spacetime”) and let V be a finite-dimensional
vector space, Lie algebra, or other suitable target space. A classical field is a map
                                                ϕ : M −→ V.
Examples
    • Scalar field: V = R or C.
    • Vector field: V = Tp M for each p ∈ M (tangent bundle).
    • Gauge field: V = su(N ); the field is a Lie-algebra-valued 1-form.
1.2     Why Spacetime Appears Fundamental
The classical view assumes that physical events are organised by differentiable coordinates permitting:
    1. A concept of locality,
    2. Differential calculus (hence equations of motion),
    3. A causal or metric structure for dynamics.
   Yet nothing in the bare definition forbids replacing M with an entirely different set of “locations”.
This observation motivates the generalisation pursued in later sections.

2     Abstract Base Spaces and Fibre-Bundle Language
2.1    Base Space X
Given any set X equipped with enough structure to support a notion of neighbourhood or adjacency,
we may call its elements locations. Minimal structures include:
    • A topology, to discuss continuity;
    • A metric or pseudometric, to discuss distance;
    • A partial order, to express causal precedence.
2.2    Value Space V
V specifies what kind of data a field carries. Classical choices are outlined in §1. In a generalised setting
V can be
    • A probability interval [0, 1] (recurrence likelihood),
    • R≥0 (information density),
    • C (interference amplitude),
    • A finite symbol alphabet Σ (tokens of cognition).
General Definition A field on X with values in V is simply a map
                                                 Φ : X −→ V.
When V varies smoothly over X one speaks of a section of a fibre bundle; the present document keeps
the exposition concrete and elementary, relegating bundle-theoretic remarks to Appendix ??.
3     p-adic Numbers and Ultrametric Geometry
3.1    The p-adic Norm
Fix a prime p. Any non-zero rational x can be written uniquely as x = pk ab with p ∤ a, b. Define
                                           |x|p := p− k ,   |0|p := 0.
The associated metric dp (x, y) = |x − y|p satisfies the ultrametric inequality
                                                    
                                   dp (x, y) ≤ max dp (x, z), dp (z, y) ,
which is strictly stronger than the usual triangle inequality.
3.2    Topology and Tree Representation
Points with small p-adic distance share long common base-p prefixes; geometrically one may embed Qp
into an infinite p-ary tree whose levels record increasing p-adic precision. Neighbourhoods are therefore
hierarchical rather than linearly ordered.
                                                        2
3.3    Fields on Qnp
One may regard
                                              ψ : Qnp −→ C
as an analogue of a quantum field. p-adic differential operators exist (Vladimirov derivative, Taibleson
fractional Laplacian) and admit wave-equation analogues; dynamics unfold along the tree hierarchy
instead of a continuum line.
4     Symbolic Configuration Spaces
4.1    Definition
Let Σ be a finite alphabet. Define
                  Σ∗ := all finite strings over Σ ,
                                                              
                                                          ΣN := all right-infinite strings .
Equip ΣN with the prefix metric
                                      ( −k
                                       2     if u and v first differ at position k,
                         d(u, v) :=
                                       0     if u = v.
This space is again ultrametric, mirroring the p-adic tree.
4.2    Fields on Symbolic Spaces
Define an information field
                                             F : ΣN −→ R≥0 ,
where F(s) quantifies the “brightness” or recurrence of string s in some cognitive process.
5     Schelling Point Calculus
5.1    Motivation
A Schelling point is a mutually predictable focal option that agents select without prior coordination.
In cognitive or information spaces, paths (reasoning trajectories) often intersect certain high-salience
loci more frequently, forming natural attractors.
5.2    Intersection Density Function
Let {Ti }i∈I be a family of trajectories Ti ⊂ X (where X is any base space from earlier sections). Define
                                                 
                                        ρ(x) := # i ∈ I x ∈ Ti ,
the intersection density. High-ρ points become Schelling attractors.
5.3    Schelling Information Field
Set V = R≥0 and define
                                              Φ(x) := ρ(x).
Viewed dynamically, trajectories update ρ as they pass; feedback then biases future trajectories toward
maxima of Φ, producing a self-focussing phenomenon.

6       Information-Theoretic Dynamics and Thermodynamic For-
        malism
6.1     Algorithmic Complexity as Energy
Let K(x) denote the prefix-free Kolmogorov complexity of a configuration x. Define a partition function
                                                X
                                        Z(β) :=     e−βK(x) ,
                                                  x∈X
with β > 0 an inverse noise parameter. Low-complexity (regular) configurations carry higher Boltzmann
weight, complementing the attractor picture in §5.
6.2     Gradient Flow on Symbolic Entropy
               X                                  P
Write S[Φ] := − P (x) log P (x) with P (x) = Φ(x)/ y Φ(y). An illustrative deterministic evolution
                x∈X
reads
                                          dΦ(x)
                                                = −∇x S + ηx (t),
                                           dt
where ηx (t) is a stochastic drive. The flow tends to condense probability mass at high-ρ loci.
7       Clarifying the Value Space V in Context
Section 2.2 listed admissible V . Summarising:
                         Interpretation                 Natural Choice of V
                         Information density            R≥0
                         Recurrence probability         [0, 1]
                         Quantum-like amplitude         C
                         Symbolic label                 Finite alphabet Σ
                         Gauge potential (classical)    Lie algebra g
   Hence a field is nothing more than a rule that assigns to each “location” a value drawn from the
appropriate V . All generalised structures above conform to this template.
8       Outlook and Research Directions
    1. Ultrametric Field Equations. Formalise kinetic terms and action principles on p-adic and
       symbolic trees.
    2. Causal-Set Quantisation. Replace X by a locally finite partially ordered set; investigate
       discretised path integrals of Φ.
    3. Cognitive Hypercomputing. Test whether Schelling attractors implement accelerated search
       (“anomalous speed-up”).
    4. Experimental Signals. Explore EEG or photonic architectures that could couple to vector-potential
       phases (A-waves) described in allied work.
