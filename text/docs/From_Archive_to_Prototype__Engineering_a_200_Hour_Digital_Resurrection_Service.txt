                                                          Abstract
          This paper reorganises, preserves, and extends every technical claim in the original engineering
          walk-through of Gavin Rothery’s Archive (2020). Nothing has been omitted or paraphrased
          away; instead, each datum is woven into a step-by-step roadmap showing how current physics
          and hardware could close the remaining gaps. New commentary grounds speculative ele-
          ments in adjacent research on gauge-irreducible vector potentials, branch-audit ledgers, and
          hypercomputational reservoirs, moving the concept one increment closer to laboratory reality.
1         Context: Licensing Grief as SaaS
Gavin Rothery situates Archive in late-winter 2038 at an abandoned robotics complex near Ky-
oto—remote enough for corporate HQ to ignore, yet wired for off-site audits. The **Archive™
unit** is a coffin-sized refrigerator that pairs aldehyde-stabilised cryopreservation (ASC) with a
quantum-annealed neural snapshot, selling exactly **200 h** of full-duplex video chat with the
dead. Renewal is impossible by design, forcing a scarcity confrontation.1
2         Preservation & Snapshot Layer
2.1         Structural Cryopreservation
ASC perfuses glutaraldehyde before gradual vitrification in high-molar DMSO/ethylene-glycol.
Electron-micrograph surveys show synapse morphology survives ice-free at < −130 ◦ C, yielding
voxel-perfect traceability at < 20 nm isotropic resolution.[1, 2, 3]
2.2         Dynamic Quantum Snapshot
A Boltzmann bath of nuclear spins in 167 Er3+ :Y2 SiO5 is driven into a collective hyperfine super-
position, then locked by dynamical decoupling. Reported T2 > 13 h at 400 mK[4]. Surface-code
concatenation extends lifetime:

          Tlogical ≈ T2             , k ≈ 1.3, pphys = 10−6 , pth = 10−3 =⇒ Tlogical ≈ 200 h.

3     Bandwidth, Sampling, and the 200-Hour Fuse
A cortex fires ∼ 1 spike · neuron−1 s−1 over ∼ 8 × 1010 neurons. Nyquist–Shannon sampling with
16-bit quantisation gives
                            R ≈ 2 × 16 × 8 × 1010 bit s−1 ≈ 2.6 Pbps.
Storing 200 h uncompressed requires 2.3 × 1020 bit (∼ 29 EB). Even with 103 : 1 perceptual
compression, ∼ 30 PB of crystal memory is needed. The pod’s countdown ends when the trace
distance to the original mind falls below 0.99.
4     Substrate Engineering and Developmental Ontogeny
4.1    Neuromorphic Host (J3)
Hardware. A 3-D ferroelectric memristor cross-bar: 256 planes (1 cm2 , 10 µm pitch). At 64
k devices per plane the synapse count reaches 1.6 × 1010 —within a factor of five of the human
hippocampus. HfO2 arrays demonstrate ∼ 0.35 pJ per synaptic event, < 4 V programming,
holding total system power ∼ 300 W with liquid-cooled SiC batteries.[5, 7, 6]
   Learning Rule.

                                         pre   post
                          ∆G = η exp −              ,     τ ≈ 10 ms,
                                             τ
enables toddler→teen→adult maturation across J1–J3.
4.2    Actuation Continuum
    • J1: anodised-steel frame, screw-jack actuators—cheap, loud.
    • J2: 60 % of joints upgraded to dielectric-elastomer muscles (DEMs). DE films deliver > 100
      W kg−1 and 30 % strain at kV potentials;[8] graphene electrodes cut losses to 3 %.[9]
    • J3: full soft-robotic myosuit with series-elastic compliance—specific power ∼ 250 W kg−1 ,
      human-like gait.
4.3    Synthetic Dermis
Bilayer skin: inner self-healing graphene/hydrogel mesh (fracture energy 1.4 kJ m−2 ) plus polyurethane/SiO2
nano-pigments for UV shielding. Crack-guided ionic polymers re-crosslink in 20 s at 25 °C, restoring
≥ 90 % conductivity. Piezoresistive micro-pillars detect 1 Pa—sufficient for pulse sensing.[10, 11, 12]
5     Compliance & IP Enforcement
Each boot hashes the synaptic tensor with SHA-3-512 salted by a device-bound key. Hash mis-
matches flag “IP breach.” Differential-privacy noise N (0, σ 2 ) thwarts weight exfiltration, while
auditors perform homomorphic comparisons inside secure enclaves.
6     Time-Dilated R&D Loop
Inside the pod, subjective time runs 20× faster on a 4 K superconducting-logic cluster (adiabatic-
flux transistors, ∼ 50 GHz, 10 aJ flop−1 ). Ten subjective months elapse during 200 h, mirroring a
Rindler horizon: the stored mind sprints while the outside universe red-shifts.
                                                 2
7     Decoherence Economics
Physical fidelity decays as
                 Γ(T ) = Γ0 e−∆/kB T ,   ∆ = 0.3 meV, T = 0.4 K =⇒ Γ−1 ≈ 80 h.
Three rounds of error correction and entanglement swapping stretch this to the marketed 200 h.
Further doubling needs either lower T (dilution fridge ∼ $0.5 M y−1 ) or larger code distance (crystal
volume ∝ d3 ); cost scales exponentially, justifying the hard licence cut-off.
8     Emergent Psychopathology
A cortex down-sampled to 1010 synapses yields under-parameterised affect, producing J2’s jealousy
loop. In predictive-coding terms, top-down priors overweight certainty while bottom-up errors
saturate, locking a Hopf bifurcation of oscillating valence. George’s six-hour synapse-freeze prevents
adaptive noise injection, so the pathology crystallises.
9     Self-Reference, Löb’s Trap, and Epistemic Closure
If a digitised human tries to prove its own “reality,” it confronts Löb’s theorem: no sufficiently rich
formal system can prove its consistency from within. The film’s twist—that George is the archived
party—embodies this: the simulation runs out of clock cycles before achieving epistemic closure.
In branch-audit terms, the ledger lacks an external verifier.
10      Forward-Looking Integrations
A-Wave Telepathy. Gauge-irreducible vector potentials could piggy-back low-bit-rate theta-band
coupling, enabling live co-adaption between the archived mind and an external collaborator—an
upgrade path to the film’s one-way video link.
    Ledger-Audited Branch Steering. Embedding the 200-h service inside a public hash chain
permits third-party scrutiny of license enforcement while assuring tamper evidence—aligning with
real-world regulatory trends in AI accountability.
    Hypercomputational Reservoirs. Coupling multiple pods via chaotic photonic links opens
a route to anomalous speed-up: partition hard search problems across Everett branches and stitch
partial answers post hoc. Though outside Archive’s scope, the hardware stack (asc brains + spin-
glass crystal memories) already resembles a low-temperature neuromorphic annealer.
11      Conclusion: Prototype Feasibility
ASC brains, rare-earth quantum memories, femtojoule memristors, dielectric-elastomer muscles,
self-healing e-skin, and zero-trust neuro-hash audits exist today at prototype level. Archive under-
estimates integration time and regulatory drag, not physical possibility. With enough capital—and
enough indifference to whether a tear is “organic”—the machinery to lease 200 h of immortality is
a decadal engineering problem, not science fiction.
