Asteroid Industry as the Starflight Scaffold
                                                  Jason Agamemnon Sokaris

                                                             Abstract
          Interstellar capability is constrained by two invariants: energy supply and accessible mass. This paper
          develops the thesis that an asteroid industrial ecology—water, silicate, and metal processing at scale—is
          the indispensable scaffold for starflight. We formalize resource classes (C/S/M), parametrize extraction and
          transport in microgravity, quantify shielding and propellant requirements, and map a software-first 2025
          roadmap for autonomous mining swarms, in-situ manufacturing, and Delay/Disruption-Tolerant Networking
          (DTN) as the Belt’s communications fabric. The emphasis is on near-term leverage (algorithms, sims,
          protocols) that pay on Earth while compounding toward a main-belt shipyard economy.
1        System Constraints: Energy, Mass, and Wells
Let E denote available continuous power and M the accessible mass budget (shielding, structure, propellant,
habitats, computation). Starflight is infeasible without (i) multi-megawatt to gigawatt power for propulsion
and life-support/hypercomputing and (ii) megatons to gigatons of mass for shielding and structures. Moving
M up a gravity well dominates cost; hence the main belt’s extremely shallow wells are structurally preferred
for scaling M .
    Let ∆v be mission velocity increment. For rocket stages, Tsiolkovsky applies:
                                                      
                                                    m0
                                       ∆v = ve ln        , ve = Isp g0 .                                 (1)
                                                    mf
Architectures that minimize ∆v per delivered kilogram of useful mass (shielding, tanks, trusses) dominate
long-horizon economics. Empirically, low-∆v NEAs (∼4–6 km s−1 from LEO) exist for prospecting, but the
belt holds orders of magnitude more material and more stable logistics windows.1
2        Resource Fundamentals and Feedstocks
2.1        Taxonomy → Composition
Asteroids cluster into C (carbonaceous, volatile-rich), S (silicaceous), and M (metallic) types with heliocentric
compositional gradients. C-types dominate outer belt; S-types are more common inward; M-types occur
throughout but are rarer. This gradient informs a feedstock map: water/organics from C-types, silicates/metals
from S-types, iron-nickel-cobalt/PGEs from M-types.2
2.2        What to Mine, For What Purpose
Water (H2 O) is the gateway resource: life support, radiation moderation, and electrolysis to O2 /H2 for
propellant depots. Silicates (shielding, basalt fiber, glass, binders). Fe–Ni metals (structural trusses, pressure
vessels, tankage). PGEs are strategically interesting in orbit (catalysts), not for Earth return this century.
3        Industrial Preconditions for Starflight
3.1        Radiation Areal Density
Let Σ ≡ ρt be areal density. Deep-space GCR mitigation yields modest marginal returns beyond ∼20–40 g cm−2
of low-Z materials (water/polyethylene/regolith), while SPE sheltering dictates thicker local storm shelters.

Design for habitation-averaged Σ with embedded storm shelters; reserve ultra-thick zones near sleeping quarters
and medical bays.3
3.2    Shipyards, Depots, and the Belt
Starships require: (i) megaton-scale shielding mass, (ii) very large, modular trusses/tanks, (iii) propellant
depots and/or beamed-power stations, (iv) autonomous fab/assembly. All are industrial, not artisanal. The
main belt is the correct location for long-cycle heavy industry; NEAs are stepping-stones and testbeds.
4     Economics Without Earth Import
Define unit mission value V and delivered in-space material cost C. For resources used in space, V grows
superlinearly with network effects: depots → logistics elasticity, shielding → crewed mission feasibility, and
structures → power and comms scaling. Earth re-entry destroys value via atmosphere, insurance, and market
crash risk (e.g., PGEs). Therefore: target in-space markets (propellant, shielding slabs, structural stock,
comms infrastructure).
5     2025 Solo-Developer Roadmap (Software-First)
You can compound toward the scaffold from a laptop:
WP1: Astrodynamics Toolkit (open-source). Build mission sketch tools using poliastro (Python)
and/or Orekit (Java/Python bindings). Deliverables: Lambert routines, low-thrust propagation, launch win-
dow searchers, and NEA accessibility scoring.
WP2: Swarm Autonomy Simulator. Microgravity-aware multi-agent control; excavation & material
handling in milligravity; cooperative rendezvous. Start in a game engine or physics sandbox with domain
randomization; produce reproducible baselines and benchmarks.
WP3: ISRU Throughput Models. Parametric extraction models for water (sublimation/heated rods/domes)
and metals (magnetics, carbothermal). Expose (resource grade, specific energy, duty cycle) → (kg/day, kWh/kg,
system mass).
WP4: DTN “Asteroid Internet” Stack. Prototype Bundle Protocol v7 nodes and routing policies under
light-time and disruption; simulate LunaNet-style services for navigation/comm coordination across swarms.
WP5: In-Space Manufacturing Playbook. Codify part families printable in microgravity (brackets,
truss nodes, tank panel jigs), material specs, QA-in-silico. Tie to design-for-assembly-by-robot conventions.
WP6: Quantitative Library. Reusable notebooks that compute: (i) areal density vs. dose proxies, (ii)
depot network refueling costs, (iii) sensitivity of economics to throughput rate and number of agents.
   Each work package is dual-use (Earth-side autonomy/networking) and directly composes into belt infras-
tructure.
6     Quantitative Skeletons (Parametric, for Reproducibility)
6.1    Shielding
Given habitable shell area A and target Σ∗ , shielding mass
                                                   Mshield = A Σ∗ .                                                 (2)
For a ∅ 30 m cylinder, A ∼ 2πrL ≈ 2,800 m2 ; with Σ∗ = 30 g cm−2 = 300 kg m−2 , Mshield ≈ 840 t for hull-only
mass moderation; storm shelters sized separately.

     Compare material performance curves across 5–40 g cm−2 ; NASA SRAG practice treats ∼20 g cm−2 as typical spacecraft
thickness for dose modeling.

6.2      Water Mining Throughput
For a thermal mining rig of power P and specific energy eH2 O (including latent and system overhead), daily
yield
                                    P
                        ṁH2 O ≈ η       , eH2 O ∼ 3–8 MJ kg−1 (process-dependent).                     (3)
                                   eH2 O
Array N such rigs and include duty cycle ϕ: Mday ≈ N ϕṁH2 O .
6.3      v-Aware Accessibility Index
            R
Define I = ∆v α with R a resource score (grade, tonnage, volatiles flag) and α ∈ [1, 2] capturing logistics penalty.
Use I to rank prospecting targets; validate against JPL small-body design tools and known low-∆v catalogs.
7        Communications Substrate: DTN for the Belt
A functioning belt economy demands asynchronous, disruption-tolerant networking. Bundle Protocol v7 over
multiple convergence layers (LTP, TCP/UDP, optical) enables store-carry-forward across swarms, depots,
relays, and planetary links. Architect for: custodial transfer, priority classes, contact plans, and late-binding
routes; mirror LunaNet concepts for positioning and time distribution in cislunar, then generalize to belt
topologies.
8        Manufacturing and Assembly: What Exists, What’s Missing
We already have space-proven plastic printing and early regolith simulant extrusion demonstrations on ISS;
satellite servicing/assembly demos have been technically promising but programmatically fragile. Your leverage
is on the software side: part libraries and robotic assembly policies that map to realistic in-space printers,
cutters, and riveters once mass is available.
9        Mars vs. the Belt vs. Earth
Earth mining is a solved, competitive industry; Mars adds gravity-well penalties and planetary protection
overheads. The belt uniquely provides low-gravity, high-mass access for scalable industry. NEAs provide
early wins (volatiles, demos) and logistics learning; the main belt is where shipyards and depots amortize over
centuries.
10        Design Principles (Condensed)
    1.   In-space use only (no Earth re-entry markets).
    2.   Water first, base metals next; PGEs much later, in orbit.
    3.   Swarm everything: sensing, mining, hauling, assembly.
    4.   DTN everywhere: assume delay, disruption, and autonomy.
    5.   Quantify in areal density, throughput, and ∆v; no vague claims.
