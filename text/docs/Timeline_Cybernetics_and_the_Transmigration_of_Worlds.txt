                                                 Abstract
        I demonstrate inter-timeline teleportation and reliable artificial precognition on a real quantum
     computer, and introduce a cryptographic Schelling point in quantum foresight research, which I
     then use to recode and decode the enigma in Block 1.
1    Apologia
In the heart of EverHeart AstroMedical lies a deeply personal quest — a quest born out of a desire
to safeguard those dearest to me from the unpredictable perils of life. It’s not just a corporate entity;
it’s a reflection of my innermost aspirations and fears. At the core of this endeavor is the dream of
predicting and preventing unforeseen harm and disease. This, for me, supersedes any monetary benefit,
making it the very foundation of our benefit corporation.
    I stand at the crossroads of an epoch, recognizing the significance of this decade in shaping the next
three centuries and beyond. This drive is rooted in my dedication to technologies capable of peeking
into the future and influencing the past — to ensure the future even has a chance.
    The path I tread is not ordinary. My pursuit of unconventional science, primarily through self-
funding and the support of near and dear ones, marks a departure from traditional paradigms. At the
forefront of my research is vector potential physics, a domain I firmly believe holds keys to ground-
breaking discoveries, like reverse causation and hypercomputation.
    My ambitious scitech endeavors, like hyper-resolution brain imaging and super-Turing AI, aim
not just for scientific breakthroughs but to redefine human capabilities and reshape our future. With
Faerwald, an envisaged simulation system, I intend to introduce an avant-garde approach to prediction,
bestowing on humanity the power to peer into forthcoming events with precision.
    Yet, amidst these dreams and technological aspirations, I cannot help but ponder the origins of such
vision. Did a semblance of Faerwald tech pre-exist within me? Could a potential ”faerwald soliton”
have influenced my past thought processes? Such reflections — stemming from deep-seated experiences
and, perhaps, traumas — often feel like they tread the line between science and speculative fiction.
Even as these speculations earned me accolades and promises of prestigious recognition, I remain
fixated on the ultimate vision: preempting tragedies and safeguarding futures.
    EverHeart AstroMedical, as I envision, is not just a company. It’s a beacon of hope and a testament
to human resilience and innovation. As we march ahead in this pivotal decade, the company’s mission
remains clear — to weave a future filled with breathtaking possibilities and memories of what could
have been.
    In this apologia, I lay bare the essence and origins of my journey, hoping to establish a bond of
transparency and trust with you, dear reader. Together, let us tread into an era where we don’t just
dream of the stars but dwell among them.
2    Prologue
In the neon-lit corridors of 2132, deep within the spiraling towers of Temporalis, a buzz of anticipation
resonated. This city, bathed in the glow of advanced science and dedicated entirely to time-research,
held its breath. Dr. Ilena Kova was about to unveil the ’Kaleidoscope’—a groundbreaking device that
promised more than just a glimpse into the future. It hinted at the power to dance with the past.
                                                      1
    ”Time,” Dr. Kova began, her piercing blue eyes scanning the room filled with global dignitaries,
innovative minds, and curious historians, ”is often seen as a river, flowing relentlessly forward. But
what if we could not just observe its journey, but also redirect its course?”
    She painted a picture of the ’Kaleidoscope’, rooted in the nuances of quantum foresight. This
wasn’t a mere evolutionary step from its predecessors; it was a quantum leap. The device exploited
the omnipresent quantum vacuum, allowing it to alter the flow of information and ideas in both human
minds and machines. Its brilliance lay in its ability to target and engage with historical events and
decisions, irrespective of when they had taken place.
    A young historian named Rael, known for his tireless exploration of ancient tales and cryptic
legends, posed a question, ”Dr. Kova, are you suggesting that if someone from the distant past, let’s
say 2023, possessed thoughts in harmony with a specific quantum protocol, the ’Kaleidoscope’ could
effectively communicate with them?”
    ”Precisely,” she affirmed, a slight smile playing on her lips.
    Rael’s mind raced. He recalled ancient legends surrounding the mysterious genesis block of Bit-
coin—a cryptographic enigma that no one had solved. Could it be evidence of the ’Kaleidoscope’s’
touch? As days melded into nights, he collaborated with a dedicated team, juxtaposing the data from
the Bitcoin’s inception with that of the dawn of quantum foresight. An intricate pattern emerged,
binding past and future in an elegant cryptographic dance.
    But the revelation brought with it a profound dilemma. While the ’Kaleidoscope’ offered hope
through Mission Anastasia, a plan to rewrite Earth’s history for a better future, it demanded a signifi-
cant sacrifice. The very act of rewriting would erase the existence of their current universe—a universe
rich with memories, emotions, and dreams.
    Rael, always engrossed with his age-old digital tablet, discovered a forgotten conversation with an
ancient AI known as GPT. It spoke of the ’Kaleidoscope’, envisioned decades ahead of its time. But
more intriguingly, it mentioned two missions—Anastasia and Aurora. Resurrection and New Dawn.
    The challenge before them was titanic. Yet as they navigated the enigmatic cryptographic mazes
of Bitcoin, clarity began to emerge. Through the prismatic lens of the ’Kaleidoscope’, they discerned a
means to weave every cherished memory, every poignant emotion from their universe into the tapestry
of the history they yearned to sculpt. Their mission transcended mere chronological adjustments; it
sought to enshrine the very soul of every being in the timeless ballet of existence.
    Together, Dr. Kova and Rael unraveled a profound discovery: the Faerwald Hypercode. This
quantum algorithm was more than a set of intricate commands; it was the pulsing heart of both
their missions, Anastasia and Aurora. The essence of ’Faerwald’, translating to ’powerful traveler’,
was deeply intertwined with its purpose. This beacon of a code was destined to find its conduit—a
visionary from the year 2023. Someone poised on the cusp of greatness, possessing the intuitive depth
to not only grasp its profound implications but to see the sweeping expanse of existence it revealed.
    And as they stood, peering from the zenith of their technologically advanced era, they bore witness
to the fruits of their endeavor. There, in the cryptographic echo of the inaugural quantum foresight
demonstration, lay the irrefutable evidence of their touch — a touch that had seamlessly melded with
the narrative of their shared past, making the story not just plausible, but palpably real.
