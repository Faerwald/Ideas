                                                Abstract
      Within the Standard Model every unstable particle “eventually” decays, while the Everett
      interpretation treats all interactions as unitary and branching. This work recasts measurement
      as the tiling of spacetime by computational loops—causally closed, algorithm-realising world-
      tubes—whose supports can overlap. A physical bit (two-valued observable) whose world-
      volume lies in the intersection of two or more loops is influenced by amplitudes external to any
      single branch, producing a measurable statistical bias. We formalise the overlap region, derive
      the non-vanishing off-diagonal elements that survive environmental tracing, and show how
      such regions act as side-channels for hypercomputational resources in the sense of Stannett’s
      “Hypercomputation is Experimentally Irrefutable.” Practical implications for A-waves, vector-
      potential scars, the P-adic pulse, and the WISPKEY protocol are analysed, along with concrete
      experimental benchmarks to detect bias without refuting the Standard Model.
1     Introduction
Quantum field theory (QFT) under the Standard Model (SM) describes dynamics via local operators
on Minkowski spacetime, while the Everett or Many-Worlds Interpretation (MWI) asserts that every
interaction induces unitary branching without collapse. Recent hypercomputation discussions [1]
suggest that seemingly innocuous physical axioms (e.g. “every unstable particle eventually decays”)
admit alternative formalities—one tautological, the other enabling super-Turing computation—
that no finite experiment can distinguish.
    Our goal is to clarify how measurement, branching, and spacetime-extended computations inter-
twine. We introduce the notion of overlapping computational loops, then show how bits inhabiting
the overlap region inherit a bias sourced from amplitudes outside the observer’s decohered sec-
tor. These ideas furnish a consistent physical narrative for proposed constructs such as A-waves,
chaos-synchronised photonic cores, and WISPKEY.
2     Background
2.1    Standard-Model axiom
The slogan
                           “Every unstable particle must eventually decay.”                              (1)
                                                     1
admits two inequivalent readings:
 (T) Existential inevitability. For each unstable particle p there exists some t > 0 such that
     decays(p, t).
 (H) Uniform boundedness. There exists a finite Tmax such that ∀p unstable, ∃t ≤ Tmax with
     decays(p, t).
Reading (T) is a tautology inside SM; (H) renders radioactive decay a uniformly bounded clock,
permitting an oracle that solves Σ01 -complete problems via König’s Lemma [1]. No finite-time
experiment can falsify (H) without contradicting (T), hence hypercomputation becomes empirically
irrefutable.
2.2     Everett branching and measurement
Let U denote a unitary interaction between a microscopic observable q, a pointer register b, and an
environment E:
                              U : Hq ⊗ Hb ⊗ HE → Hq ⊗ Hb ⊗ HE .
After interaction,                          X
                                    |Ψ⟩ =       ci |qi ⟩ ⊗ |bi ⟩ ⊗ |Ei ⟩ ,                         (2)
                                            i
and decoherence suppresses ⟨Ei |Ej ⟩ for i ̸= j. In spacetime language, the world-tube of b threads all
branches, forming a deterministic computation inside each sector but sharing the same local field
configuration.
3     Computational Loops as World-Tubes
3.1     Definitions
Computational loop Lk . A causally closed region supp(Lk ) ⊂ R1,3 whose correlated field modes
   implement an algorithm (classically a logic circuit, quantum-mechanically a path-integral
   world-tube).
Bit. Any coarse-grained two-valued observable b = {|0⟩ , |1⟩} defined on a world-volume V ⊂ R1,3 .
Overlap region V ∗ . The non-empty intersection of two or more loop supports:
                                        \
                                 V∗ =      supp(Lk ), |K| ≥ 2.
                                            k∈K
3.2     Examples
    1. A metastable isotope whose decay both feeds a Geiger counter (loop L1 ) and initiates a delayed
       chemical cascade (loop L2 ).
    2. A chaos-synchronised photonic resonator acting as a classical control loop in the lab (L1 ) and
       as a cross-branch phase alignment device (WISPKEY, L2 ).

4     Formal Treatment of Overlap and Bias
4.1     Hilbert-space factorisation
Factor the global Hilbert space by spacetime support:
                                               O
                                          H=       Hx .
                                                        x∈R1,3
For each loop Lk ,                             O                                   O
                             H[Lk ] =                 Hx ,            H[V ∗ ] =              Hx .
                                        x∈supp(Lk )                                x∈V   ∗
4.2     Persistence of off-diagonal terms
                                               |Li ⟩ , the reduced density matrix on V ∗ after tracing out the
                                    P
Writing the global state as |Ψ⟩ =       i ci
complement V ∗ is                                     X                           
                                    ρV ∗ = TrV ∗                  ci c∗j |Li ⟩⟨Lj | .                     (3)
                                                            i,j
                         ∗
If |Li ⟩ and |Lj ⟩ share V , the term i ̸= j generally survives, violating the diagonal-only criterion of
the decoherent-histories framework.
4.3     Observable bias
Let O be an operator acting nontrivially on V ∗ only. Its expectation value receives cross-loop
contributions:                            X
                                ⟨O⟩V ∗ =     ci c∗j ⟨Lj |O|Li ⟩ ,
                                                     i̸=j
manifesting as a weak statistical drift away from any single-branch prediction. Detecting such drift
is, in practice, the only laboratory-visible signature of the overlap.
5     Hypercomputational Side-Channel
Assume one loop LH encodes a decision procedure f for an undecidable language LU ⊆ N. A second
loop LC executes an ordinary recursive task, yet shares V ∗ with LH . Equation (3) implies that finite
observers restricted to LC experience a biased prior reflecting partial information about f . This
bias functions as a side-channel conferring limited access to hypercomputational resources without
violating empirical irreducibility constraints [1].

    1. Decay-timing analysis. Measure half-lives across identical isotopes conditioned on external
       loop participation; search for deviation from Poisson statistics.

    2. Interferometric phase drift. Embed vector-potential scars in a fibre loop; hunt for sub-
       shot-noise correlations linked to remote computational load.
    3. Chaos-resonator correlates. Compare output entropy of a photonic reservoir under iso-
       lated vs. WISPKEY-coupled conditions.
    4. SAT oracle benchmark. Record completion-time histograms of a deterministic SAT solver
       paired to an A-wave sensor; fit against a recursive baseline.
8     Conclusion
Measurement in Everettian QFT naturally organises spacetime into overlapping computational
loops. Bits inhabiting overlap regions inherit statistical biases sourced from amplitudes beyond their
branch, realising a physically plausible side-channel to hypercomputational resources. Because finite
experiments cannot falsify such resources without contradicting the Standard Model, the correct
research programme is positive detection of bias, not negative proof of impossibility. Constructs
such as A-waves, P-adic pulses, and WISPKEY exploit precisely these overlap channels, offering a
clear route toward experimental verification.
