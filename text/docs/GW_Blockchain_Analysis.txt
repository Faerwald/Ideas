A Day’s Reflection on GW & Blockchain Analysis

                                                         March 4, 2025
Today, I took a big step back and looked closely at the data, the code, and this entire gravitational-wave-and-blockchain
project I’ve been tinkering with. I poured my creativity and my scientific rigor into building Python scripts that sliced and
diced every piece of data I had. I tried wavelet transforms, frequency-domain analyses, near/far partitions—everything. After
all that, it’s pretty clear I’m not finding anything meaningful in these correlations. In a way, that’s oddly satisfying. As a
scientist, I realize there has to be a point where I say, “Enough is enough. I’ve done my due diligence.” If I kept searching
indefinitely, I’d be stuck in an endless rabbit hole. So I’m taking the day’s outcomes as a success story. I learned a lot, and
I’ve gained confidence in where not to spend my energies.
The best part is seeing how far I’ve come—thinking up this entire concept, developing code, running repeated tests, writing
up a little lab report. I’ve done real experiments, and that, in itself, is a huge deal. It proves I can pick up a wild idea and test
it systematically. That sense of freedom, of not being locked into “safe” thinking, is a core part of my creative and scientific
process. And yet, I also know how to let go when it’s time to move on. I don’t feel like I failed. It wasn’t a failure to find no
correlation. It’s a valid and informative result. Negative results in science aren’t negative in the emotional sense—they are
clarifying.
I feel something close to relief, actually. Yes, I’m worn out, exhausted from the intellectual intensity of writing scripts,
checking p-values, analyzing waveforms, and generating plots. But I’m also proud that I reached a stopping point. This is
me practicing good science: form a hypothesis, test it thoroughly, conclude, and move on. If I dig deeper, it’s not that my
intelligence was lacking—quite the opposite. My intelligence helped me realize quickly that I might be chasing fantasy. And
that realization is a healthy check on my curiosity; it keeps me grounded in achievable, fruitful ideas.
So tomorrow, I’ll wake up feeling lighter. I’ll wake up feeling free from this “maybe time travelers rewrote the blockchain”
storyline. And that freedom sets me back on the track of real engineering. I have the tools, the brilliance, and the drive
to build actual technologies that matter. My negative result wasn’t truly negative at all—my code, my approach, and my
perseverance were all positive demonstrations of a scientific mind at work. It’s an example of what it means to learn from
every experiment, even if the data says “No correlation here, sorry.”
I’m proud of myself. I did the experiment, compiled the data, and compiled my notes. I’ll label it as done, so I can focus my
energy on the next idea. That’s what real science is: test, refine, or discard, then repeat. I’m ending the day both exhausted
and relieved, satisfied that I stuck to a rational threshold for continuing vs. stopping. And in that sense, I succeeded mightily.
I can’t wait to tackle tomorrow with a fresh perspective—grounded in reality, eager to build tangible creations, and in full
knowledge that it’s okay to let the improbable fade away to make room for what’s truly possible.
