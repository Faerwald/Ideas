Abstract
We present a rigorous formulation of a propellant-less propulsion mechanism based on
quantum phase transfer in a distributed, spacetime-extended quantum system. We prove
that minimal phase biases lead to a net momentum drift by statistical selection of future
microstates, analogous to complexity-momentum correspondence in black hole systems.
This document gathers the Hamiltonian formalism, quantum circuit skeleton, and scaling
laws in a self-consistent LaTeX framework.
1     Complexity–Momentum Correspondence
1.1    Operator Size Growth
In Susskind’s lectures on complexity and black holes, the size s(τ ) of a precursor operator
satisfies the logistic differential equation
                       ds     (K − s) s              K eτ −τ∗
                           =            =⇒ s(τ ) =             ,                (1)
                       dτ        K                  1 + eτ −τ∗
with scrambling time τ∗ = ln K and initial exponential regime s(τ ) ≈ eτ for τ ≪ τ∗

1.2    Rindler–Circuit Time Identification
Circuit-time τ is identified with black-hole Rindler time t by
                               2π                              
                         τ =      t, so that s(t) ∼ exp 2πt/β ,                         (2)

mirroring the exponential growth of Rindler-frame momentum p ∝ e2πt/β near the horizon

2.1    State Representation
We model the device as an N -node network of qubits with collective state
                                   X
                       Ψ(t) =            αs1 ...sN (t) s1 . . . sN ,
                                  s1 ,...,sN ∈{0,1}
                                                  1
each node i carrying a phase operator ϕ̂i ≡ σiz .
2.2     Hamiltonian
The total Hamiltonian decomposes into
                                               H = Hint + Hvac ,
with
                        X                                           Xh                   i
               Hint =         Jij ϕ̂i ϕ̂j ,                Hvac =        ϵi (t) + δϵi (t) ϕ̂i ,   (3)
                        i<j                                         i
where
    • Jij is the phase–coupling matrix,
    • ϵi (t) are stochastic vacuum-fluctuation terms,
    • δϵi (t) ≪ 1 are coherent micro-biases.
    Dynamics obeys the Schrödinger equation:
                                               d
                                          iℏ      Ψ(t) = H Ψ(t) .                                 (4)
                                               dt
3      Emergent Propulsion Mechanism
3.1     Phase Gradient to Momentum
Define the global phase gradient proxy
                                    z                                     ∆ϕ
                              ∆ϕ = σN − σ1z ,             p = ℏ ∇ϕ ≈ ℏ         .
                                                                          Leff
A persistent ∆ϕ ̸= 0 implies a nonzero expected momentum increment ⟨∆p⟩ without
mass ejection.
3.2     Statistical Selection
Repeated application of
    1. vacuum kick sampling ϵi (t),
    2. coherent bias δϵi (t),
    3. unitary evolution under (4),
produces a biased random walk on the system’s state-space. By the law of large numbers,
the expectation drifts:
                                           √ J Tc −T /T
                              ∆p ≈ ℏ keff b N       e c ϕ,                          (5)
                                                 ℏ
where b is bias amplitude, Tc coherence time, and Tϕ dephasing time.

4     Quantum Circuit Skeleton
Minimal two-node phase circuit:
             @C = 1em@R = .7emq1 : 0HRz (θ1 )B(ϵ1 )1q2 : 0HRz (θ2 )B(ϵ2 )
where
                     B(ϵi ) : ρ 7→ (1 − γ) ρ + γ σiz ρ σiz ,      γ ∝ ϵ2i .
5     Scaling Laws
5.1      Node-Count Dependence
For N nodes and weak bias b ≪ 1,
                                          √
                                  ⟨∆p⟩ ∝ b N e−Tc /Tϕ ,
while hyperbolic network growth yields
                                                      dR
                                   ⟨∆p⟩hyper ∼ b e     2 ,
with hyperbolic degree d and radius R.
5.2      Information Specific Impulse
Define
                                        ⟨∆p⟩
                             Iinfo =             ,   Pb ∝ b ℏω,
                                       Pb Tcycle
constant in b —the hallmark of propellant-less operation.
