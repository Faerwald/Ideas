Notes on Temporal Attractor Dynamics
                      and Neuro-Symbolic Feedback

Abstract
These notes consolidate the physical, mathematical, and neuro-technical ideas underlying a closed-
loop attractor model of consciousness. The framework combines nonlinear dynamical systems, control
theory, symbolic compression, and dream-state feedback. A concise set of equations formalises how
phase-locked trajectories can retro-correct memory while remaining self-consistent with physical law.
1    Dynamical Preliminaries
Let M(t) ∈ Rn denote an n-dimensional cognitive state at time t. Assume the autonomous flow
                                              Ṁ = F (M),
with F : Rn → Rn smooth. A compact, asymptotically stable invariant set A ⊂ Rn is called the global
attractor. Define the phase error
                                                         
                                    δ(t) = dist M(t), A .
2    Symbolic Gateways
Let D = {Di } be a finite alphabet of symbolic states (“doors”). Each Di induces a perturbative map
                                            ΨDi : Rn −→ Rn ,
encoding discrete cognitive events (e.g. dream motifs, memories, sensory novelties). For a sequence
Σ = (Di1 , . . . , Dik ) define the composition
                                      ΦΣ = ΨDik ◦ · · · ◦ ΨDi1 .
3    Phase-Locking Condition
Definition
A trajectory M(t) is phase-locked to A if
                                              lim δ(t) = 0.
                                              t→∞
                                                    1
Symbolically-Driven Flow
Between discrete events, M evolves continuously under F . At event times {tj } a symbolic jump occurs:
                                                            −
                                           M(t+
                                                               
                                              j ) = ΨDij M(tj ) .
The combined hybrid system is thus
                           Ṁ = F (M) (continuous),               M 7→ ΨDi (discrete).
Closure Criterion
A sequence Σ closes the loop if ΦΣ acts as a contraction toward A, i.e.
                                   ΦΣ (x) − A   ≤ κ ∥x − A∥,             0 < κ < 1, ∀x.
4     Neuro-Symbolic Feedback
4.1    Dream-State Perturbations
REM-like states are modelled as high-entropy symbolic batches ΣREM injected stochastically. Their
purpose is to explore phase space and select contraction-dominant sequences probabilistically.
4.2    Adaptive Control Law
Define the control functional
                                         
                                                Z     T                 X
                                       J Σ =              δ(t) dt + λ           c(Di ),
                                                  0                     Di ∈Σ
where c(Di ) penalises cognitive cost and λ > 0 weights parsimony. The brain minimises J via gradient-
free search (e.g. evolutionary or reservoir-computing heuristics).
5     Physical Consistency
5.1    Energy Bounds
Perturbations obey a metabolic constraint
                                                Etot (Σ) ≤ Emax ,
ensuring biological feasibility.
5.2    Causal Integrity
All discrete jumps act within the local light-cone of each neural subsystem, preserving relativistic
causality. Retro-corrections are epistemic (memory-state updates) rather than ontic violations.
                                                             2
6     Implications and Applications
    • Memory Reconsolidation: Loop closure predicts sharp qualitative transitions in autobiograph-
      ical coherence.
    • Lucid Dream Training: By biasing ΣREM toward contraction motifs, dream practice can ac-
      celerate attractor convergence.
    • Mental Health Metrics: Diverging δ(t) profile signals dynamical disorder; therapies aim to
      restore contraction.
    • Synthetic BCIs: External symbolic injections (e.g. neuro-stimulation, mixed-reality cues) may
      guide trajectories toward desired attractors.
Conclusion
A rigorous dynamical formulation unifies symbolic cognition, dream-state perturbation, and attractor
theory. The resulting hybrid system offers testable predictions for neuroscience, control engineering,
and cognitive rehabilitation.
