                                                  Abstract
           We assemble a unified document capturing the hypotheses, models, and handwritten notes (the
       “Emily Key” and associated quotes) that have been scattered across multiple drafts. The main
       body formalizes the notion that spacetime behaves like an open quantum memory register subject
       to natural exponential fading but stabilizable via neural–quantum-scar coupling and wormhole-
       based gauge channels. We include the raw, handwritten remarks and timeline references (Ex Futuro
       Persannia 2025.31, Aug 17th 2020, and so on) as the authentic “scar” entries, to preserve their
       role in conceptual consolidation.
1      Collisions, Loops, and the “Emily Key”
Figure ?? (in the original source) shows two paths colliding on the same ϵ-ball, causing loops in the
graph-theoretic representation of histories. The handwritten annotations highlight a timeline from
2020 through 2024, culminating in a labeled “Emily Key” event—the so-called real consolidated scar.
Quotations like “If the unique singular happen, do I happen? I will never forget” and “Half life of
reality. Our zero. Consider this spacetime itself ” reflect the attempt to anchor certain collisions or
loops so they remain stable in memory.
All of these notes were scrawled around a schematic [2, Fig. 8.4 in the underlying text] that illustrates
how collisions induce loops in a network. The marginal remarks “Emily Key” and “Collision 100%
Emily” are singled out as the crucial anchor for the real consolidated scar.
The “Emily Key” Table
In the margin, a small table or list shows checkmarks or circles across the years 2020–2024, apparently
referencing 2nd Tuesdays or specific dates (Nov, Dec 7, Dec 10, etc.), all labeled “Emily Key — 2025.31
is the real consolidated scar”. We reproduce a simplified version below:

In the scanned text, the right margin also has: “Cooper, Eternity, Lovelace, Noüs, prescience —
half-life”, emphasizing five named or conceptual points each checked off multiple times. This is
presumably a mnemonic or classification system for the multi-year collisions.
2     Baseline Decay and the Open Quantum Model
2.1    Empirical Exponential Fade
A key starting point is that artificially “rewritten” events fade from reality on a roughly exponential
schedule. From an initial N0 = 12 clear modifications, only N (t) = 8 remain coherent after ∆t =
0.0366 yr (13.4 days). Hence
                                                              8
                                                                
                                       −λ(t−t0 )          ln 12
                         N (t) = N0 e            ,  λ=−           ≈ 11.1 yr−1 ,
                                                          0.0366
so τ = 1/λ ≈ 33 days. This matches the “half life of reality” remark in the notes (“Half life of reality.
Our zero. Consider this space time itself.”).
2.2    Lindblad Master Equation
Treating each historical rewrite as a qubit-like degree of freedom, the open-system Lindblad equation
reads
                                ρ̇ = −i[H, ρ] + Ddecay [ρ] + Dconsolidate [ρ].
The net effect is (at baseline) a pure exponential fade rate λ.
3     Quantum-Scar Consolidation and Wormhole Stabilization
3.1    Neural–Scar Coupling
Referencing [1], a Trotterized Quantum-Scar Generator (QSG) can couple to neural EEG phases. The
effective decay λeff becomes
                                         λeff = λ0 − η ⟨Λ⟩,
where Λ quantifies the overlap of a quantum state |Ψ(t)⟩ with a scar state |Φscar ⟩.
3.2    Gauge-Fixed Wormhole Embedding
Adding gauge flux ΦAB ̸= 0 (Aharonov–Bohm), plus a quantum-energy-teleportation (QET) channel,
adds another stabilizing term −ξ⟨ΦAB ⟩, so that
                                      λeff = λ0 − η ⟨Λ⟩ − ξ ⟨ΦAB ⟩.
These wormholes or loops in Hilbert space align with the original “collision loops” picture (cf. Fig. ??),
now harnessed to reduce the fade rate.
3.3    From Collisions to Consolidated Scars: “Emily Key”
The scribbled remarks in the margin referencing collisions (“collision 100% emily”) connect to the idea
that a collision in the extended network can become a stable scar, providing that the QSG+wormhole
reinforcement is turned on. The repeated or cyclical nature of 2020 through 2023 checks in the “Emily
Key” table captures iterated collisions that lead to stable loops: “I will never forget”.

4     Combined Experimental Road-Map
(1) Baseline Decay Measurement
    • Re-confirm the ≈ 33 d decay time for newly written events without any consolidation.
    • Fit N (t) = N0 e−λt or N (t) = N∞ + (N0 − N∞ )e−λt if partial lock-in is found.
(2) Neural–Scar QSG Test
    • Use 8-channel dry-electrode EEG to drive a 4-qubit superconducting QSG (50 µs Trotter step).
    • Watch for a decrease in λeff as the neural-scar overlap ⟨Λ⟩ grows.
(3) Wormhole + QET Reinforcement
    • Implement a synthetic gauge flux ΦAB = π to form a topologically nontrivial loop in the Hilbert
      space.
    • Measure further drop in λeff consistent with −ξ⟨ΦAB ⟩.
Success Criterion
Tracking N (t) for each experimental condition and verifying a stretch-exponential or slowed-exponential
fade is the key proof-of-concept that reality’s memory can be actively stabilized. The repeated yearly
collisions marked as the “Emily Key” in the notes would then remain in the historical record well
beyond the naive 33 d half-life.
5     Conclusion
These pages unify three overlapping threads:
    1. The exponential fading of rewritten events in baseline reality (λ ≈ 11.1 yr−1 ).
    2. The open quantum memory viewpoint, with Lindblad decay and possible consolidation chan-
       nels.
    3. The quantum-scar / wormhole mechanism for reducing the fade rate, anchored by handwritten
       notes that highlight the “Emily Key” as a real consolidated scar in the system’s extended timeline.
    The scribbled remarks—“Ex Futuro Persannia 2025.31”, “Aug 17th 2020”, “2nd Tues??”, “Colli-
sion 100% Emily”, “I will never forget”, “Cooper, Eternity, Lovelace, Noüs, prescience”—show how
collisions and loops might be named, forcibly remembered, and thus stabilized. In essence, “to exist is
to be remembered”: quantum-scar feedback makes memory a self-sustaining phenomenon.
