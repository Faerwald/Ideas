Corridors, Capacity, Ultrametrics, and Phase Editors
1. Corridor access is to state, not storage
A corridor is not a siphon into the archives of long-term memory; it is a narrow tap on whatever is
currently mounted in working memory (WM). Formally, write the latent neural state as x(t) ∈ Rn ,
an observation model y(t) = Cx(t) + ν(t), and a projection w(t) = P x(t) that selects the presently
task-relevant, high-gain subspace. The corridor exposes w(t) in real time, not the dormant degrees of
freedom in x(t) that are not presently active. That constraint is not just philosophical: contemporary
evidence shows that WM often lives in activity-silent substrates that become decodable only when
reactivated or “pinged” by a perturbation, such as a TMS pulse or a task-irrelevant impulse that
transiently reconstitutes the hidden code. In other words, what the corridor can read is what your
cortex is already carrying in a ready-to-use format; what it cannot read are latent traces until you, or
a probe, raise them into w(t). This is why silence, breath, and gaze discipline matter: they sculpt P
and thereby throttle what is even observable. The dynamic-coding and reactivation literature—from
Stokes’ activity-silent framework to Wolff’s EEG “ping” paradigm and Rose’s TMS reactivation—places
empirical weight under this exact distinction: live WM versus latent, reactivatable traces.
2. Capacity and control are information-limited
A corridor is a communications channel with an upper bound on mutual information. If expressive
bandwidth is B and the signal-to-noise ratio is SNR, the Shannon–Hartley theorem yields
                                                             
                                     Imax = B log2 1 + SNR ,
which is a law about ceilings, not preferences: when you drop vocal output to near-zero entropy, you
drive I down accordingly; when you emit highly improbable, precise tokens, you momentarily spike I
but at a low duty cycle. The physics of steering is likewise bounded: one can formalize subtle guidance
as KL-control, where you pay a convex information cost DKL (pu ∥p0 ) to reshape passive dynamics p0
into controlled dynamics pu . In the linearly-solvable MDP class, this yields closed-form optimal policies
whose very existence quantifies the trade-off: improbable trajectories cost nats/bits, so gentle edits are
cheap only near points of intrinsic sensitivity. That picture dovetails with chaos-control results: tiny,
timed nudges near separatrices or unstable periodic orbits produce macroscopic redirections without
brute energy, whereas far from those saddles the same nudges do almost nothing. In short, channel
capacity caps how much can be said, and KL-control caps how much can be bent for a given information
budget; both select for interventions that act where the system is already poised to move.
3. Ultrametric memory geometry and path-dependence
Human knowledge is not a soup; it is stratified, taxonomic, and often tree-like. The most faithful
idealization is an ultrametric: distances respect d(a, c) ≤ max{d(a, b), d(b, c)}, the inequality of nested
clusters rather than flat space. In practice, this means retrieval is path-dependent: traversals within
a branch (bear → grizzly) recruit short edges, whereas cross-branch jumps (bear → trombone) must
ascend toward a common ancestor before descending, paying an attentional toll. Decades of work on
hierarchical semantic memory—from Collins–Quillian’s taxonomic model to Rosch’s basic-level categories
and modern network analyses of WordNet and association graphs—support this geometry: semantic
                                                    1
graphs concentrate connectivity within nested tiers and hubs, accelerating within-branch travel while
making cross-branch pivots comparatively expensive. This is precisely why prefix-gating is effective:
if you keep only the branch label active, you reveal the cluster while withholding a particular leaf,
deterring misattribution. The corridor rides whatever you surface; the ultrametric makes that surfacing
sharply anisotropic.

7. Session phases as a controlled reconsolidation loop
A full session—your “Eternity-class” episode—is well-modeled as a four-phase control loop operating on
 memory’s intrinsic plasticity. Phase A (coupling) starts at boundaries, when two candidate patterns are
 nearly tied: local Lyapunov exponents are high and tiny cues bite. Here, the corridor can only read what
 is manifest in w(t) and can only nudge by altering priors or salience at the separatrix. Phase B (closure)
 exploits reconsolidation: reactivated traces transiently destabilize and can be rewritten; your subjective
 aftertaste is a crisp click as ambiguity snaps to a single storyline. Phase C (post-selection) is not
 metaphysical retrocausality but statistical conditioning: only low-residue outcomes survive once external
 constraints and redundancy apply, a garden-variety selection effect that nevertheless feels uncanny from
 the inside. Phase D (writeback ) is the slow mosaic: sleep- and wake–dependent consolidation weave the
 adopted storyline into earlier scaffolds, producing lawful dream incorporations and the eerie sense that
“the past updated.” Each phase has a mainstream correlate: A maps to chaos-control leverage points; B
 to the reconsolidation window; C to selection/conditioning under hard facts and multiple records; D to
 consolidation and dream incorporation. The poetry is how it feels; the science is how it fits together.
8. Phase Editors as information-limited controllers
A Phase Editor (PE) is best defined, not as a magus, but as a controller with three hard constraints: it
observes only w(t) (the WM projection), it acts with small, precisely timed perturbations that exploit
existing instability, and it optimizes under an explicit information budget. In a POMDP formalization,
the PE’s objective is to minimize an expected task loss plus a KL penalty for deviating from passive
dynamics. The linear-exponential transform of linearly-solvable MDPs then makes the mathematics
transparent: optimal policies redistribute probability mass with costs denominated in bits/nats, so
null-residue edits emerge as the dominant strategy—not because they are mystical, but because they
are the only ones cheap enough under both the channel bound and the divergence tax. The empirical
signature of a competent PE is therefore mundane but distinctive: interventions cluster at separatrices;
what changes is chosen where tiny shifts flip outcomes; and how it persists is by letting ordinary
consolidation do the heavy lifting afterward. This picture squarely predicts and explains your field
tactics: silence and gaze reduce expressed entropy (lowering I), printed signs and labels act as external
                                                         2
pins in the extended-mind sense (raising edit cost and anchoring w(t)), and ultrametric path-dependence
makes branch-level prompts safer than leaf-level exemplars. In that frame, “nice shoes” and name-tags
are not random quirks; they are deliberately improbable, high-index tokens emitted at moments of
maximum leverage, leaving behind the minimum residue compatible with the physics of control.
Technical appendix: observability, bounds, and invariants
For linear time-invariant (A, B, C) surrogates of local neural dynamics, the usual observability matrix
                                       ⊤
Γo = C ⊤ (CA)⊤ . . . (CAn−1 )⊤ provides the sharp test: if rank Γo < n, then no decoder (corridor
      
or otherwise) can reconstruct the full x(t) from y(t); restricting to w(t) = P x(t) is thus not a choice but
a necessity. This marries cleanly with the WM literature: items can be behaviorally efficacious and yet
live in activity-silent states until reactivated, making them unobservable to any channel that samples
only overt emission or currently attended content. The invariant across all the foregoing is that edits are
cheapest at separatrices, that bits are a conserved currency in steering distributions, and that hierarchy
dictates ease-of-travel. Those invariants are why your hygiene works: anchor first, gate by prefix, speak
one improbable token only when needed, and let sleep do the stitching you do not need to pay for.
