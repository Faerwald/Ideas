Aionauts, Allelaxis, and Palimpthavens: A Formalism
           ⟨Jason Agamemnon Sokaris | .F.A.E.R.W.A.L.D⟩
                                                    Abstract
          We develop a mathematically explicit framework for entities and infrastructures that navigate
     isotemporal possibility, synthesizing a lexicon—centaurian, aionaut, allonaut, allelaxis, weavepoint,
     palimpthaven, ruleflux, monochthon, poly-chthon, terrabound, centaur-lock, decentauration—with
     first principles from geometry, probability, control theory, information theory, and gauge physics.
     The aim is neither pure fiction nor unfalsifiable metaphysics: we isolate precise objects, morphisms,
     invariants, and measurement procedures that render the concepts testable in principle and interop-
     erable with ongoing work in gauge-irreducible vector potentials (“A-waves”), cybernetical physics,
     chaos control, and Schelling-point calculus. We formalize: (i) a category of worlds indexed by
     time and possibility; (ii) a fiber-bundle view of the Aionline as a supratemporal transport layer;
     (iii) weavepoints as coincidence loci defined by phase and code invariants; (iv) palimpthavens as
     address-stable but state-rewriting attractors; (v) ruleflux as local generator drift measured by
     operator distances; (vi) centauriancy and decentrauration as learnable operators on belief-state
     geometry; and (vii) control protocols that use closed-loop phase integrals of the electromagnetic
     vector potential to realize stable allelaxial alignment. The result is a compact but extensible
     calculus suitable for both narrative design and laboratory prototyping.
1    Preliminaries: State Spaces and Indices
Let T ⊂ R denote physical time and let Ω denote an allelaxial index set of possibilities at fixed clock
time. A world is a pair (t, ω) ∈ T × Ω with physical state X(t, ω) ∈ X , where X is a measurable state
space (e.g., a manifold with σ-algebra).
Isotemporal allelaxis. An allelax move is a morphism at constant time:
                                     αt : (t, ω) → (t, ω ′ ),        ω ̸= ω ′ .
A chronax move is a morphism that advances time:
                                  χω : (t, ω) → (t′ , ω),       t′ < t or t′ > t.
We collect worlds as objects and allelax/chronax moves as arrows in a small category
                                                                       
                            Worlds = Obj = T × Ω, Arr = {αt } ∪ {χω } .
Aion layer. We adjoin an external object E (“Aion”) with arrows ι : (t, ω) ⇆ E : π representing
entry/egress to an extratemporal coordination layer. Agents leveraging these maps are aionauts; agents
performing purely allelax moves are allonauts.
Schelling information. Let Σ be a finite or countable set of salient symbols (focal coordinates;
hypotheses; motifs). Define a symbolization map S : X → ∆(Σ) into distributions on Σ. A Schelling
point is a maximizer σ ⋆ ∈ Σ of a shared utility or mutual information functional across separated agents
or worlds.
2    Bundles, Sheaves, and the Aionline
Define the Aionline as a principal fiber bundle
                                       π : E → B,          B = T × M,
where M is a base manifold of operational contexts (e.g., spatial loci, network addresses, cognitive
charts). Fibers encode allelaxial degrees of freedom, with structure group G acting transitively on Ω.
Local trivializations U ⊂ B admit π −1 (U ) ∼
                                            = U × G.
                                                       1
Weavepoints. A weavepoint is a point b ∈ B admitting a G-equivariant section s : U → E whose
induced holonomy around any small loop γ ⊂ U stabilizes a designated invariant I:
                                         Holγ (s) ∈ StabG (I),
with StabG (I) = {g ∈ G : g · I = I}. Operationally, weavepoints are ingress coordinates where
code/phase invariants persist across allelaxis.
Palimpthavens. A palimpthaven is an address b ∈ B with a stable identifier id(b) and a Markov
kernel Kb that rewrites internal state upon each visit:
                                   µn+1 = µn Kb ,         µn ∈ ∆(Xb ).
The address persists (id(b) stable), while the realization µn evolves. Convergence to an invariant
distribution µ⋆ or to a limit cycle defines degrees of palimpthicity.
Sheaf view. Let U be an open cover of B. A presheaf F assigns to U ∈ U the set of admissible world-
sections X|U subject to gluing axioms. Weavepoints correspond to stalks with nontrivial automorphism
groups preserving I.
3    Gauge Phases, A-Waves, and Allelax Invariants
Let A denote the electromagnetic vector potential. For a closed loop C rooted at b ∈ B, define the
AB-phase                                        I
                                              q
                                        ΦC =       A · dl.
                                              ℏ C
Axiom (Weave invariance). A weavepoint b is certified by a set of loops {Ck } for which ΦCk takes
a quantized value set Q independent of ω ∈ Ω:
                                   ∀ω ∈ Ω, ∀k :         ΦCk (b, ω) ∈ Q.
This renders allelaxial alignment phase-labeled : an allonaut maintaining ΦCk ∈ Q navigates laterally
without losing the ingress reference.
A-waves. Suppose a gauge-irreducible component of A (not removable by single-valued χ) propagates
through B with dispersion ω(k). Let A(b) denote a local functional of A (e.g., Wilson loops). We model
A-wave beacons as fields b 7→ A(b) whose level sets define weavepoint basins.
4    Ruleflux: Measuring Local Law Drift
Let dynamics near b be generated by a Markov semigroup {Pt }t≥0 with generator L acting on observables
f ∈ D(L):
                                        d
                                          E[f (Xt )] = E[Lf (Xt )].
                                       dt
Between allelaxial neighbors (t, ω) and (t, ω ′ ), define ruleflux as operator distance
                                RuleFlux(t; ω, ω ′ ) := ∥Lt,ω − Lt,ω′ ∥op ,
with ∥·∥op induced by a chosen Banach space of observables (e.g., bounded Lipschitz). Small ruleflux
implies near-isodynamics; large ruleflux signals regime change despite equal clock time. Invariant
weavepoints satisfy
                          RuleFlux(t; ω, ω ′ ) ≤ ϵ within a certified basin.
                                                    2
5    Centauriancy and Decentauration as Operators on Belief
     Geometry
Let H be a statistical manifold of agent beliefs (e.g., an exponential family) equipped with Fisher–Rao
metric g. A centaurian is an agent whose belief support is concentrated on one century’s regularities;
formalize with a projector Πcent : H → H onto a century-restricted submanifold Hcent .
Centaur-lock. A fixed point h⋆ ∈ Hcent is a centaur-lock if for any update operator U drawn from
a family of cross-century evidence transformations, U (h⋆ ) ∈ Hcent . Lock strength can be quantified by
the smallest λ such that
                                 d U (h⋆ ), Hcent ≤ λ d h⋆ , H \ Hcent
                                                                      
for all admissible U , where d is the geodesic distance under g.
Decentauration. A decentauration operator D is a controlled flow on H (e.g., mirror descent with
cross-century priors) that monotonically decreases the projection error
                                         E(h) := ∥h − Πcent h∥g
while increasing mutual information with a multiera corpus. One class uses schedule-controlled noise
injections and curriculum over ruleflux levels, forming a homotopy Hτ from Hcent to a trans-era manifold
Hinter .
6    Monochthons, Poly-chthons, and Cross-Well Generaliza-
     tion
Let G index gravity wells (planets, stations). An agent’s embodiment induces sensory-action channels
with channel laws p(y|x, g). A monochthon is adapted to a single g ∈ G; a poly-chthon generalizes
across a subset GS .
   Define a transfer risk for task family T :
                                                          h                   i
                                               ′                   ⋆
                              Rtrans (θ; GS → g ) := Eτ ∼T lossg (θ (GS ; τ )) ,
                                                                ′
where θ⋆ (GS ; τ ) is the parameter learned on environments GS . Poly-chthony corresponds to uniformly
bounded Rtrans across g ′ ∈ / GS .
7    Allonautics: Isotemporal Transport and Coding
We model allelaxis as transport along fibers at constant t. Let ω carry a codeword c(ω) ∈ C ⊂ {0, 1}n
with a metric dC . A lateral hop selects ω ′ with dC (c(ω), c(ω ′ )) ≤ r. A palimpthaven-compatible hop
requires preservation of invariants:
                                      I X(t, ω) = I X(t, ω ′ ) .
                                                                  
The resulting isotemporal navigator solves
                     min RuleFlux(t; ω, ω ′ ) s.t. dC (c(ω), c(ω ′ )) ≤ r, ΦCk ∈ Q.
                     ω ′ ∈Ω
                                                    3
8     Weavewalking via Gauge-Aware Control of Chaos
Let zk+1 = F (zk , uk ) + ηk be a discrete chaotic system (e.g., logistic, Hénon) embedded in the agent-
environment loop, with control uk and noise ηk . Define a phase-locked cost combining AB-phase
deviation and ruleflux:
               K−1
               X        X                     2                                                     
          J=         α         ΦC (zk ) − qC        + β RuleFlux tk ; ωk , ωk+1 + γ dC c(ωk ), c(ωk+1 ) .
               k=0       C∈C
Weavewalking chooses u0:K−1 to minimize J subject to state constraints. Under OGY-type chaos
control, small perturbations stabilize otherwise unstable allelaxial orbits satisfying the phase constraints.
9     Palimpthaven Dynamics and Verification
Let visits occur at {tn } with internal states ξn ∈ Xb . The palimpthaven kernel induces
                                         ξn+1 ∼ Kb (ξn , ·),         ξ0 ∼ µ0 .
Identifiability. If there exists a set of loop functionals {ΦCk } and probes fj such that
                                            
                       {Eµn [fj ]}j , {ΦCk }k determine the conjugacy class of Kb ,
then the palimpthaven is experimentally characterizable despite allelaxial rewrites.
Attractor typing. Define the empirical spectral gap γ emp from return-time statistics; classify palimpthavens
by (γ emp , dim Xb , |Q|).
10      Schelling-Point Calculus for Inter-World Coordination
Let agents Ai in worlds (t, ωi ) share a focal prior over Σ. Define a coordination functional
                                X                                                 
                                     λ1 I σ; S(X(t, ωi )) − λ2 RuleFlux t; ωi , ω σ ,
                                                         
                      U(σ) =
                                   i
where ω σ is the allelax neighbor maximizing alignment with symbol σ. A Schelling weave is a selection
σ ⋆ maximizing U(σ) such that the induced multi-agent hop preserves weave-invariants.
11      Centaurian Diagnostics and Training
Centauriancy index. Given a feature map ϕ : X → Rd and a multi-era reference Dmulti , define
                                                ∥Eh [ϕ] − EDcent [ϕ]∥
                                   CI(h) =                                ∈ [0, ∞).
                                               ∥EDmulti [ϕ] − EDcent [ϕ]∥
High CI indicates centaurian lock-in.
Decentauration curriculum. Increase ruleflux exposure gradually: present environments with RuleFlux ∈
[0, ϵ1 ], then [ϵ1 , ϵ2 ], etc., while reinforcing weave invariants. Train on palimpthaven revisit tasks requiring
invariance under Kb across allelaxis.
                                                             4
12     Aionauts and External Orchestration
An aionaut accesses E to compute global weave plans. Model E as a supervisory optimization over
plans P with constraints:       X              X               2 
                            min      Ji (p) + λ    ΦCk (p) − qk      ,
                                p∈P
                                      i             k
subject to causality-respecting write limits on (t, ω). External write limits implement “faceless/no-
trace” policies by bounding KL-divergence in local observation channels.
13     Addressing and Codes for Stable Ingress
Let C be a linear block code with parity-check H. A weavepoint address is a coset a + C. An ingress
attempt uses a probe sequence s; successful ingress if
                                      Hs⊤ = Ha⊤     and ΦCk ∈ Q.
Palimpthavens use time-varying syndromes Hn drawn from a stationary ergodic process with invariant
coset class.
14     Measurement of Anomalous Speedup (Allonautic Regime)
Define a problem family {Πm } with verifier V . Baseline expected time Tbase (m) (classical search under
local rules). Observed time Tobs (m) under weavewalking. Evidence for allelax leverage:
                        Tbase (m)
               ∆(m) =             ≫ 1,    with matched energy and information budgets.
                        Tobs (m)
Control experiments hold AB-phase off-invariant to test that speedup collapses when weave constraints
are violated.
15     Minimal Laboratory Sketches
(1) AB-Phase Gated Navigation
Construct two interferometers sharing spatial coordinates but differing internal contexts (two ω-variants
via boundary condition contrast). Encode weave-invariant Q by flux quantization. Implement a chaotic
controller on a reconfigurable photonic or electronic map; penalize phase deviations and observe stabi-
lization of lateral hops that preserve interference signatures.
(2) Palimpthaven Identification
Implement a physical memory whose write kernel Kb is nontrivial but address-stable (e.g., memristive
crossbar with hidden adaptation). Demonstrate invariant ingress (syndrome match + phase) while
content evolves; estimate γ emp and reconstruct Kb up to conjugacy from probe/response data.
(3) Decentauration Training
Train human or synthetic agents on multi-era tasks with increasing ruleflux. Measure CI reduction,
weavepoint retention under perturbations, and transfer to cross-well simulators (altered gravity priors).
                                                   5
16     Taxonomy and Formal Definitions
[Centaurian / Inter-centaurian / A-centaurian] Given Hcent ⊂ H, an agent h is centaurian if h ∈ Hcent ;
inter-centaurian if h lies in a union of century-conditioned charts with bounded transition distortion;
a-centaurian if h admits a representation invariant under century reparameterizations.
    [Allonaut] An allonaut is a policy π over Ω at fixed tthat minimizes expected ruleflux under weave
constraints. Formally, π ∈ arg minπ E RuleFlux(t; ω, ω ′ ) subject to ΦCk ∈ Q.
    [Aionaut] An aionaut is a two-stage policy (ΠE , π) where ΠE computes global plans in E respecting
write limits, and π executes local allelax steps consistent with the plan and weave invariants.
    [Weavepoint] A base point b ∈ B with (i) an invariant I, (ii) a neighborhood U admitting a section
with holonomy in StabG (I), and (iii) a certified AB-phase set Q independent of ω ∈ Ω.
    [Palimpthaven] An addressable locus b with stable identifier and a nontrivial kernel Kb producing
address-stable, content-evolving returns. Its type is the triple (γ emp , dim Xb , |Q|).
    [Ruleflux] Operator distance between local generators across allelaxis at fixed t, measured in a chosen
observable norm.
    [Monochthon / Poly-chthon / Terrabound] Let G index gravity wells. A monochthon is adapted to
a single g ∈ G; a poly-chthon generalizes to multiple g with bounded transfer risk; terrabound is the
Earth-specific monochthon.
17     Compositionality and Category-Theoretic View
Let W be the category above. Define subcategories:
             A = isotemporal allelax morphisms,       C = chronax morphisms,       E = {ι, π}.
A weave functor F : W → Inv maps worlds to invariant sets and arrows to invariant-preserving maps;
palimpthavens then appear as endomorphisms with nontrivial internal Markov structure. A monoidal
product ⊗ on invariants models multi-agent composition; compatibility with holonomy yields coherence
conditions for team weavewalking.
18     Risk and Identifiability Bounds
Let Φ
    b be a noisy estimator of Φ. If Φb ∼ N (Φ, σ 2 ) i.i.d., then distinguishing Φ ∈ Q from Φ ∈
                                                                                              / Q with
type-I error α and type-II error β requires
                                      2σ 2  −1               −1
                                                                       2
                                 N ≳ 2 Φ (1 − α) + Φ (1 − β) ,
                                      ∆
where ∆ is the minimal separation between Q and its complement, and Φ−1 denotes the Gaussian
quantile.
    Similarly, estimating RuleFlux within ε (in operator norm) using empirical generators from time
series of length T requires T scaling with the inverse spectral gap and mixing coefficients of the processes
at (t, ω) and (t, ω ′ ).

20     Worked Micro-Example (Symbolic)
Consider two allelax neighbors ω0 , ω1 at time t. Let local linear generators on features f ∈ Rd be
L0 f = A0 f and L1 f = A1 f , with Ai ∈ Rd×d . Then
                                 RuleFlux(t; ω0 , ω1 ) = ∥A0 − A1 ∥2 .
Let C be a loop whose AB-phase is ΦC = ℏq A · dl = 2πm for m ∈ Z (quantized set Q). A simple
                                           H
weavewalk step chooses ω1 such that ∥A0 − A1 ∥2 is minimal subject to ΦC ∈ Q and a code radius r in
dC .
21     Discussion: Plausibility and Program
The formalism separates address invariants (phase and code) from content dynamics (palimpthaven
kernels) and local law drift (ruleflux), enabling principled navigation across isotemporal possibilities.
The AB-phase role is standard physics (closed-loop line integral of A); its use as an address stabilizer
is novel but consistent with gauge-invariant labeling. Chaos control provides minimal-energy pertur-
bations to hold a system on allelax-compatible orbits. The decentauration program reframes cross-era
cognition as geometric optimization on belief manifolds with curriculum over ruleflux. Each construct
admits empirical signatures and falsification routes, aligning speculative navigation with laboratory-
grade measurement.
