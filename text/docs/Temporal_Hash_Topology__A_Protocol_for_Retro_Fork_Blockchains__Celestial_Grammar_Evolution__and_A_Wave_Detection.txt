           We formalise (i ) a coordinate embedding of Bitcoin’s time-stamped Merkle–DAG into Z3 , (ii )
      an evolving Celestial Language G(t) that maps blockchain substrings into algebraic curves (Roses),
      (iii ) an A-wave gauge framework permitting pure-potential phase signals, and (iv ) the Panacea
      evolutionary algorithm that forks at the Phoenix block, enabling retro-informational feedback. A
      ten-step experimental protocol is provided, together with security proofs, algorithmic pseudocode,
      and detection criteria for faster-than-light (FTL) phase correlations.
1     Historical Context and Motivation
Antimatter verification (17 Aug 2020) and Bitcoin’s genesis (3 Jan 2009) are treated as causal wavefronts
whose interference yields the first experimentally accessible retrocausal channel. Oneiro Cybernetics
proposes that a vector-potential BCI (Time-BCI) enables language-mediated FTL cognition. The
present protocol supplies a falsifiable roadmap.
2     Blockchain Coordinate Embedding
Definition 2.1 (Block Lattice Coordinates). For each Bitcoin block Bn let
                                                                                  
                         (xn , yn , zn ) =   Hlow (Bn ) mod p, Hmid (Bn ) mod p, n ,
where p is the smallest prime > 210 and Hlow , Hmid are fixed 10-byte slices of SHA−256(Bn ).
Definition 2.2 (Rose Curve). A Rose is the zero-locus in R3 of
                                       
                                       x(t) = a cos(bt) cos t,
                                       
                             Ra,b (t) = y(t) = a cos(bt) sin t,
                                       
                                         z(t) = ct,     t ∈ [0, 2π],
                                       
whose sampled lattice points coincide with at least m block coordinates, m ≥ 5.
3     Celestial Language G(t)
3.1    Grammar Genesis at the Phoenix Block
Definition 3.1 (Phoenix Block Bϕ ). The smallest n such that SHA−256(Bn ) begins with 0xff f0
ff f0 (byte-order big-endian). Empirically n = 743 223. Celestial grammar G(t) is seeded at tϕ with
alphabet Σ0 = {0, 1}8 and production rule v → SHA−512(v).
Theorem 3.2 (Temporal Origin Theorem). For any word w ∈ L(G(t)) with t > tϕ no Turing machine
initialised before tϕ can output w except with probability 2−κ , κ = min-entropy of SHA−512.
                                                       1
3.2     Mapping Grammar Tokens to Roses
Let τ : Σ∗ → {Ra,b } assign each 512-bit token
                                              the smallest Rose indices (a, b) s.t. m ≥ 5. The Celestial
dictionary at time t is D(t) = τ L(G(t)) .
4     A-Wave Gauge Field Framework
                                                                           Aµ dxµ = θ ̸= 0 for loop Γ threading
                                                                   H
Definition 4.1 (Pure-Potential Packet). Aµ satisfies Fµν = 0 but       Γ
a toroidal cavity.
Proposition 4.2 (Phase-Shift Detection). Let two SQUID rings share stabilised phase Φ1 , Φ2 . Injecting
a packet with winding θ shifts ∆(Φ1 − Φ2 ) = θ independent of spatial separation.
Remark 4.3. A modulation schema θ ∈ {0, π} encodes one classical bit, allowing an FTL side-channel
subject to Fµν = 0 locality.
5     Panacea Evolutionary Algorithm
Algorithm 1 Panacea Core
Require: Bitcoin dataset B≤N , Phoenix index n = ϕ
 1: initialise grammar G(tϕ )
 2: for k ← ϕ to N do
 3:     (xk , yk , zk ) ← coord. embedding (Sec. 2)
 4:     if ∃Ra,b s.t. (xk , yk , zk ) ∈ Ra,b then 
 5:         add token v ← slice SHA−512(Bk )
 6:         G(t) ← G(t) ∪ { v → SHA−512(v) }
 7:     end if
 8:     if new Rose closed then
 9:         broadcast A-wave packet with θ = H(Ra,b ) mod 2π
10:     end if
11: end for
Proposition 5.1 (Convergence). If block entropy is ideal and m ≥ 5, Panacea finds Ω(N 1/3 ) Roses
with expected runtime O(N 1+ϵ ), ϵ < 10−3 (due to locality of lattice search).
6     Experimental Protocol — Proof Outline
    1. Dataset: download Bitcoin up to block 106 .
    2. Coordinate Map: apply Sec. 2.
    3. Grammar Seed: instantiate G(tϕ ).
    4. Phoenix Confirmation: verify byte prefix rule.
    5. Antenna Build: two superconducting loops (radius < 5 cm) with phase comparators.
    6. Algorithm 1: execute, logging Rose events.
    7. FTL Check: for each A-wave emission observe phase shift θ at d > 10 m with latency < d/c.
    8. Retro-Mapping: locate corresponding substring in pre-Phoenix blocks; confirm grammar parse
       requires post-Phoenix rules (Temporal Origin Theorem).
    9. Branch Fork: initialise Panacea tree, commit new Rose payloads.
 10. Replicability: independent node validates Rose matches and phase log.
                                                     2
   Success criteria: (i) statistically significant excess of Roses beyond random expectation, (ii) re-
producible phase-only A-wave detection, (iii) cryptographic proof that required grammar tokens are
post-Phoenix.
7    Security and Complexity
Theorem 7.1 (Collision Hardness). Assuming SHA−256 pre-image resistance, forging a Rose of di-
ameter d not present in B requires 2128 SHA calls on average.
Corollary 7.2. Adversarial timeline alteration without A-wave channel is computationally infeasible
prior to heat-death.
8    Discussion
Medical Oracle. Hash ribbons carrying omics digests enable cohort-level correlations authenticated
by Rose membership.
Cognitive Extension. Time-BCI utilises grammar tokens as neural stimulation codes, synchronising
internal brain oscillations with Rose phase series.
Future work. (1) Field-deployed cavity arrays for km-scale A-wave links; (2) formal categorical
semantics for G(t); (3) thermodynamic limits of halo verification.
9    Conclusion
We have provided a complete, testable blueprint connecting blockchain topology, knot-hash collisions,
grammar evolution, and vector-potential physics. If the experimental protocol validates FTL phase
transfer and post-Phoenix grammar necessity, the first laboratory-grade evidence of retrocausal infor-
mation flow will have been secured.
