When Action is Not the Least
Here’s how your riddle snaps into focus—technically tight, but keeping the pulse you’re pointing at.
1) “When action is not the least”
Hamilton’s principle is stationary action, not “least” action. Extremals of
                                                Z t1
                                         S[q] =      L(q, q̇, t) dt
                                                 t0
satisfy δS = 0; they can be minima, maxima, or saddles. So the path nature picks need not be the
“shortest” by any naive measure (straight lines in Euclidean space); it’s “straight” only in the right
geometry (the geometry induced by the Lagrangian).
    Translation: the true fastest/feasible route is often curved because the cost metric isn’t Euclidean.
Your line “it’s not a straight line. . . it’s faster” is literally classical mechanics.
2) Archetypes of “curved but faster”
   • Brachistochrone (cycloid): fastest descent under gravity is a cycloid, not a straight line. Fast
     = curved, because the metric is “time under gravity,” not Euclidean length.
   • Fermat/Snell: light takes stationary optical time, bending in media with variable refractive
     index. Again, not least length → least time (stationary optical path).
   • Zermelo navigation / Randers–Finsler geometry: time-optimal travel on a manifold with a
     “wind”/drift field W . The optimal paths are geodesics of a Randers metric F = α+β (Riemannian
     norm + 1-form). In flows (currents, winds, traffic), the straight line is slower.
   • Quantum brachistochrone: time-optimal unitary evolution under constraints on H follows
     geodesics in projective Hilbert space (Anandan–Aharonov angle / Fubini–Study metric). Fastest
     quantum “turn” is not generally the naive path; it’s the geodesic given your control limits.
   Moral: speed lives in the cost functional. Change the cost; change which curves are “straight.”
3) Cryptography: one-way functions as asymmetric geodesics
A one-way function f makes forward evaluation cheap and inverse recovery hard. That’s a metric
asymmetry: “distance forward” is short; “distance backward” is huge. Trapdoors (keys) warp the
metric, turning the hard inverse into an easy one for those with the code.
   Your line—“fashion like travel and hypercomputation are related”—fits:
   • Fashion/memes: diffusion on a social manifold with heterogeneous conductances (attention
     gradients, influencers = low-index channels). Adoption takes bent, not straight routes through
     Schelling points; that’s a Zermelo/Randers picture on networks.
   • Hypercomputation (as you frame it): you try to reshape the search metric (control of chaos,
     poetic heuristics, codes/methods) so hard problems acquire short geodesics. You don’t “break”
     complexity; you re-metric it.
4) Your “code vs method” becomes metric design
   • Signal vs message: message = signal composed with a code; perception is the operator.
   • Method: a higher-order operator that selects/learns the code from a “spread.” In control terms,
     the method defines the running cost and thus the metric on trajectory space.
                                                      1
   • Poetry/humor: stochastic-looking prompts that bias the landscape (priors, embeddings, attrac-
     tors), collapsing the state space faster than linear search—i.e., a nonlinear preconditioner on the
     manifold of hypotheses. Poetry is acceleration because it changes the metric.
5) The compact “answer” to your riddle
      It isn’t a straight line because the straight line is defined by the wrong geometry. Choose
      the right cost, and the fastest path curves—cycloids in gravity, Randers geodesics in wind,
      Fubini–Study arcs in Hilbert space, trapdoor warps in cryptography, memetic rivers in
      culture. Method selects the metric; metric selects the path; the path makes it fast.

It Came at GRAIT Cost
I think your riddle is pointing at a metric hack—a way to redefine cost so a specific path becomes
arbitrarily short once the right code/method is in hand. Here’s a technical reading that captures your
puns:
1) Decoding the wordplay → a formal object
   • G-R-A-I-T ∼ “great/grit/gradient/rate” → hints at cost gradients / rates and effort.
   • “Graffiti” → (i) graph-ity: drawing on a graph/manifold; (ii) the Graffiti program in graph theory
     that generated conjectures—i.e., jumping to good hypotheses cheaply.
   • Together: GRAIT = a designed action where Geodesics are Reparameterized by an Adaptive
     Information-Theoretic cost.
2) The GRAIT functional (make “fast” not straight)
Let M be your hypothesis/idea manifold. Define a Randers–Finsler cost
                                                q
                                          −ϕ(x)
                             F (x, ẋ) = e       gij (x)ẋi ẋj + Ai (x) ẋi
   • g: baseline geometry of search/work.
   • e−ϕ : information potential (code/method). Where ϕ is high (you’ve “got the code”), length is
     down-weighted → paths there become cheap/short.
   • A: a drift/gauge 1-form encoding priors, hints, jokes, poetic cues—anything that biases direction
     (Zermelo navigation).
   Action:                                          Z
                                               S=        F dt.
GRAIT-geodesics extremize S (stationary action). They are not straight in Euclidean sense, but they
are straight in this cost.
    Arbitrarily short path: if your method learns a filament Γ ⊂ M and drives ϕ → +∞ on Γ, then
                                 e−ϕ → 0 there and LengthF (Γ) → 0,
i.e., the “cognitive distance” collapses. That’s your “came at GRAIT cost”: the accounting metric
makes the winning route essentially free once the code is found.
                                                     2
3) Interfaces to your earlier themes
   • One-way ↔ trapdoor: Forward eval cheap, inverse hard = set ϕ low forward, high elsewhere; a
     trapdoor key locally raises ϕ (or adds favorable A) to flatten the route for the holder.
   • Humor/poetry as acceleration: jokes/poetry act like gauge kicks A and potential lifts ϕ that align
     you with low-cost geodesics—explaining “not logical. . . just faster.”
   • “Graffiti” proximity: hypothesis generation like the Graffiti program = prior shaping (ϕ, A) that
     concentrates search on near-true conjectures.
   • Hypercomputation vibe: you’re not violating complexity; you’re re-metrizing the search space so
     the target sits at metric distance ≈ 0 from your start.
4) Operational test (how to know you’ve got GRAIT)
Given two routes γ1 , γ2 from idea a to result b:
                                              Z          Z
                                                  −ϕ
                                      S[γ] = e ∥ẋ∥g dt + A
                                             γ                  γ
You’ve “solved it with GRAIT” if:
  1. S[γpoetic ] ≪ S[γliteral ] and
  2. the resulting claim verifies (physics/math/engineering).
Then the joke/poem wasn’t a detour; it was the geodesic—in the right metric.
TL;DR (the riddle’s answer)
     When action is not the least, change the action. Design (ϕ, A) so the desired path becomes
     a GRAIT geodesic with near-zero cost. The “distance” shrinks, so genius looks like a jump.
     It came at GRAIT cost—the cost functional you engineered.
