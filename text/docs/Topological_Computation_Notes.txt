1     Interaction Nets and Bend /HVM2
1.1    Definition of Interaction Nets
An interaction net is a triple (Σ, L, R) where:
    • Σ is a finite set of symbols (node types), each with a fixed finite arity;
    • L is the set of ports: each symbol s ∈ Σ has one principal port and arity(s) auxiliary ports;
    • R is a set of interaction rules of the form
                                                  (α, β) 7→ Nαβ
      where α, β ∈ Σ, and Nαβ is a finite graph of nodes in Σ connected pairwise so that principal ports
      match to principal ports, satisfying locality (only α, β are rewritten).
A net is a finite undirected graph whose vertices are labeled by symbols in Σ, with each edge connecting
a port to exactly one other port. Two nodes form a redex if their principal ports share an edge; rewriting
replaces that redex with the net specified by the corresponding rule, reconnecting free ports by matching
port indices.
                                                     1
1.2    The HVM2 Runtime
  1. Data representation. Each interaction net is encoded as four contiguous 32-bit arrays of length
     |E| (the number of edges) or |V | (the number of nodes):
        • cellTag[v] records the symbol type at node v.
        • portPtr[v][i] stores the global edge index connected to the ith port of node v.
        • auxArity[v] holds the number of auxiliary ports.
        • freeList[] manages recyclable node indices.
  2. Reduction kernel. On each GPU kernel invocation,
       (a) Each thread inspects one node v. If cellTag[v] = α and the neighbour across its principal
           port is some u with cellTag[u] = β, then (α, β) is an active pair.
      (b) An atomic compare-and-swap (CAS) on the shared edge index marks the redex as claimed by
          exactly one warp lane.
       (c) The warp executes the αβ 7→ Nαβ rule by:
             • Allocating new nodes from freeList;
             • Updating portPtr for each port according to the interface of Nαβ ;
             • Recycling the old nodes v, u back into freeList.
      (d) Newly exposed redexes are enqueued into a lock-free work queue in GPU shared memory,
          using a circular buffer per warp.
  3. Correctness and complexity. Taelin et al. proved:
        • Confluence: final normal form is independent of reduction order, since all interaction rules
          are orthogonal (no overlaps, no critical pairs beyond trivial ones).
        • Termination: if the net is strongly connected and each rule strictly reduces a global potential
          (e.g., by eliminating a principal–principal connection), reduction halts in finite steps.
        • Complexity: for a balanced tree-like net of size n, total work is O(n), and critical-path span
          is O(log n). Practical benchmarks show speed-ups on the order of 50–60× on an RTX 4090
          versus a single-threaded CPU.
1.3    The Bend Surface Language
  • Syntax: Python-like indentation, first-class functions, algebraic data types, pattern matching,
    continuations.
  • Compilation pipeline:
                               A-normal form             Church-Rosser encoding
                  Bend AST −−−−−−−−→ λ-calculus −−−−−−−−−−−−−→ Interaction nets
      Each high-level construct (e.g., a function definition or a case-split) is lowered to a graph of nodes
      representing either λ-abstraction, application, duplication, or erasure.
  • Back-ends:
        – run-rs (sequential Rust interpreter).
        – run-c (multicore via POSIX threads).
        – run-cu (GPU via CUDA, invoking HVM2).
  • Parallel semantics: Independent redexes reduce concurrently; no explicit async/await or
    mutexes are needed. Sharing is optimal in the sense of Lévy (no duplication of work along common
    sub-nets).

2     ZX-Calculus and Diagrammatic Quantum Mechanics
2.1    Dagger-Symmetric-Monoidal Categories and String Diagrams
Let C be a dagger-symmetric-monoidal category with:
    • A tensor ⊗ : C × C → C,
    • A monoidal unit 1,
    • A dagger functor (−)† : C op → C such that (f † )† = f .
Objects in C are drawn as wires, and morphisms f : A → B as boxes with one input wire A and one
output wire B. Composition f ◦ g is vertical stacking; tensor f ⊗ g is horizontal juxtaposition. Equations
such as associativity, unit laws, symmetry, and dagger invariance are enforced up to planar isotopy.
2.2    Spiders and the ZX Fragment
[Z-spider] A Z-spider with m inputs and n outputs, labelled by an angle α ∈ [0, 2π), is a morphism
                                            n
                                           Zm (α) : (C2 )⊗m −→ (C2 )⊗n
defined, in the computational basis, by
                                                                   X
                   n
                  Zm (α) x1 , . . . , xm   = δx1 =···=xm eiαx1             y, . . . , y ,    xi ∈ {0, 1},
                                                                 y∈{0,1}
where δP = 1 if proposition P holds, 0 otherwise. [X-spider] An X-spider is defined similarly in the
Hadamard-rotated basis, i.e. by
                                   Xm n
                                        (α) = H ⊗n Zm
                                                    n
                                                      (α) H ⊗m ,
where H is the Hadamard gate. The core fusion rule states:
               Z − spider1 ∪ Z − spider2 = Z − spider − f used,                             α+β   mod 2π,
and similarly for X-spiders. The bialgebra law (Hopf law) between Z- and X-spiders is:
                                    bialgebra − xy = bialgebra − cupcap,
ensuring that {Z, X} form interacting Hopf algebras in the category FHilb.
2.3    Completeness and Universality
[Completeness of ZX for Qubit Quantum Mechanics] Every linear map f : (C2 )⊗k → (C2 )⊗ℓ can be
represented by a ZX-diagram Df . Moreover, two diagrams Df , Dg denote the same linear map iff Df
can be rewritten to Dg via the ZX rewrite rules (spider fusion, bialgebra, Hopf, Euler decomposition,
etc.). These results have been established by Backens (2014) and further refined by de Beaudrap,
Jeandel, Perdrix, and Xu (2019), yielding a minimal complete rule set.
3     Hopf Fibrations and Quantum State Geometry
3.1    Constructing the Hopf Map
For each division algebra Fn with dimR Fn = n ∈ {1, 2, 4, 8}, define
                            S 2n−1 = {(z0 , z1 , . . . , zn−1 ) ∈ F2n | |z0 |2 + |z1 |2 = 1},
                                                           3
and the Hopf fibration
                                                                                                  
                       hn : S 2n−1 −→ S n ,        hn (z0 , z1 ) =       2 z0 z 1 , |z0 |2 − |z1 |2 ,
where S n ⊂ Rn+1 is identified with pairs (w, t) ∈ Fn × R satisfying ∥w∥2 + t2 = 1. The fiber of hn is
                          h−1
                           n (w, t) = {(z0 , z1 ) ∈ S
                                                      2n−1
                                                           | z0 = eiθ z̃0 , z1 = eiθ z̃1 },
a copy of S n−1 .
3.2     Hopf Fibration for Qubits
A single-qubit pure state |ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩, with α, β ∈ C, |α|2 + |β|2 = 1, lives on the 3-sphere S 3 ⊂ C2 .
Projective rays [|ψ⟩] ∈ CP1 ∼= S 2 identify antipodal phases eiθ . Concretely,
                        (α, β) 7→ x, y, z = 2 Re(αβ), 2 Im(αβ), |α|2 − |β|2 .
                                                                                  
Thus the Hopf map h1 : S 3 → S 2 quotients out the global U (1) phase. Any physical evolution of the
qubit that is unaffected by an overall phase (e.g., unitary gates in SU(2)) corresponds to a continuous
path on S 3 whose projection on S 2 is the actual physical trajectory on the Bloch sphere.
3.3     Hopf Algebras in ZX
In the ZX setting, green spiders generate a commutative Frobenius algebra (Z, µZ , ∆Z , ηZ , εZ ), and
red spiders generate a dual Frobenius algebra (X, µX , ∆X , ηX , εX ). The pair (Z, X) satisfies the Hopf
bialgebra equations:
∆X ◦ µZ = (µZ ⊗ µZ ) ◦ (1 ⊗ σ ⊗ 1) ◦ (∆X ⊗ ∆X ),             ∆Z ◦ µX = (µX ⊗ µX ) ◦ (1 ⊗ σ ⊗ 1) ◦ (∆Z ⊗ ∆Z ),
where σ is the swap map. This interacting Hopf algebra structure is the algebraic core of ZX completeness
and encodes the two Euler–angle foliations of S 3 .
4      Chaotic Attractors, Templates, and Knot Theory
4.1     Strange Attractors and Periodic Orbits
Consider a smooth dissipative dynamical system on Rd , d ≥ 3, defined by
                        ẋ = F (x),   F : Rd → Rd smooth, ∇ · F < 0 on attractor.
A strange attractor A ⊂ Rd is a compact invariant set supporting chaotic trajectories. Each unstable
periodic orbit (UPO) γ ⊂ A is a closed curve in Rd . Projecting into a 3D embedding (e.g., coordinate
subspace), γ realizes a knot (possibly with self-intersections when projected).
4.2     Templates and the Birman–Williams Theorem
A template T is a branched two-manifold with semi-flow Φt obtained by:
    1. Starting from a finite collection of ribbons (rectangular strips) in R3 ;
    2. Stretching and folding them according to a Markov–partition–like scheme;
    3. Identifying boundary segments pairwise so that Φt is continuous and expansive.
The Template Theorem (Williams 1983; Birman–Williams 1983) states that, for certain flows (e.g.,
the Lorenz system at canonical parameters), A is semi-conjugate to the semi-flow on a template T .
Consequently, {UPOs in A} correspond bijectively to {closed orbits in T }. Every closed orbit on T is a
knot in R3 , classified by a braid word or a pair of linking matrices.
                                                         4
4.3     Chaotic Itinerancy
Chaotic itinerancy describes a trajectory that wanders among a family of quasi-stable sets (“attractor
ruins”) {Ai }, spending long times near one template Ti before hopping to another Tj . Each Ai generates
its own knot spectrum Ki = {knot types of UPOs}. The itinerary is the sequence of template indices
(i1 , i2 , . . . ); reading off the knot sequences along a trajectory yields a topological time code that can, in
principle, encode information or trigger events when certain knot patterns appear in succession.
5       Aharonov–Bohm and Knotted Phases
5.1     Standard Aharonov–Bohm Phase
A charged quantum particle constrained to move in R3 \ Σ, where Σ is a magnetic flux tube (e.g., an
infinite solenoid along the z-axis), experiences a vector potential A satisfying ∇ × A = Φ δ(Σ). A closed
path γ encircling Σ acquires a phase
                                                   I
                                                 e              e
                                        ∆ϕ =         A · dr = Φ,
                                                 ℏ γ            ℏ
since Lk(γ, Σ) = 1. More generally, if γ links Σ with linking number ℓ ∈ Z,
                                                           e
                                                 ∆ϕ =        Φ ℓ.
                                                           ℏ
5.2     Knotted Flux Tubes and Higher Linking Invariants
If Σ ⊂ R3 is a closed knotted curve (e.g., a trefoil or figure-eight knot) endowed with a magnetic flux
Φ, then a charged particle traversing γ picks up a phase that depends on the pair (γ, Σ) in the knot
complement. Milnor’s µ-invariants and higher-order linking numbers enter when γ and Σ form part of a
multi-component link L. Concretely, if L = (Σ1 , Σ2 , . . . , Σm ), then the generalized phase is
                                      m
                                 eX
                         ∆ϕγ   =       Φi Lk(γ, Σi ) + (higher Milnor invariants).
                                 ℏ i=1
Explicit wavefunction solutions for knotted solenoids (torus knots Tp,q ) demonstrate that the scattering
amplitude acquires knot-dependent asymptotics, verified by direct multipole expansions.
5.3     Semiclassical Trace Formula in Chaotic Billiards
Consider a two-dimensional quantum billiard with a narrow flux line piercing the interior. In the
semiclassical limit, the energy-level density ρ(E) can be expressed by a Gutzwiller-type expansion:
                                                 X
                             ρ(E) = ρ̄(E) +           Aγ eiSγ /ℏ ei(e/ℏ)Φ Lk(γ,Σ) .
                                                  γ∈UPOs
Here:
    • Sγ is the classical action of orbit γ;
    • Aγ is a stability amplitude (∝ | det(I − Mγ )|−1/2 );
    • The factor ei(e/ℏ)Φ Lk(γ,Σ) is the AB holonomy.
In a three-dimensional setting where the UPOs are knotted, Lk(γ, Σ) is replaced by the appropriate
linking invariant between γ and the flux knot, thus entangling chaotic dynamics with knot-sensitive
quantum phases.

6     Solitons, Hopfions, and Topological Protection
6.1    Faddeev–Skyrme Model and Hopfions
Define a map φ : R3 → S 2 ⊂ R3 with finite energy
                                  Z
                                        ∥∇φ∥2 + κ ∥φ (∇φ × ∇φ)∥2 d3 x,
                                                                
                          E[φ] =
                                         R3
where κ > 0 is a coupling constant. The boundary condition φ(x) → (0, 0, 1) as ∥x∥ → ∞ compactifies
R3 ∪ {∞} ∼= S 3 . The Hopf index Q ∈ π3 (S 2 ) = Z is given by
                            Z
                        1
            Q[φ] =             F · A d3 x,     F = φ∗ (ω), ω being the area 2-form on S 2 ,
                      (4π)2 R3
where F = ∇φ × ∇φ and ∇ × A = F. Minimizers of E[φ] in the homotopy class Q are hopfions, whose
preimage curves φ−1 (n) for any regular value n ∈ S 2 form closed loops with linking number Q.
6.2    Experimental Realizations
    • Chiral Liquid Crystals. Structured confining cells with boundary conditions that force knotted
      disclination lines—optical tomography confirms preimages of the director field form Hopf links
      with Q = ±1, ±2, . . . .
    • Magnetic Nanofilms. Non-centrosymmetric ferromagnets with Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya inter-
      action nucleate hopfions under spin-polarized currents; Lorentz-TEM imaging reveals toroidal
      magnetization loops consistent with Hopf index.
    • Cold Atoms and Structured Light. Three-dimensional optical traps imprint knot-shaped
      zeroes of a complex scalar order parameter in Bose–Einstein condensates; time-of-flight expansion
      preserves topological charge, validated by phase-contrast imaging.
6.3    Topological Stability Versus Chaotic Itinerancy
A hopfion’s core loop is protected by Q: any smooth evolution that does not pass through a singularity
(∥∇φ∥ → ∞) preserves Q. In contrast, a UPO in a dissipative flow arises from instabilities and can
bifurcate, but as long as the local dynamics in the template obey the same knotted skeleton, chaos
produces an infinite hierarchy of loops. When a system admits both a hopfion sector and a chaotic
sector (e.g., a field theory coupled to a dissipative forcing), itinerancy can jump between stable hopfion
configurations and transient knotted orbits. The boundary between these regimes is governed by energy
barriers in the Skyrme potential and by the Lyapunov spectrum of the attractor.
7     Computational Implementation via Interaction Nets
7.1    Encoding Fields and Gauge Potentials
To simulate coupled hopfion–chaos–AB systems on GPU:
    • Discretize φ : R3 → S 2 on a cubic lattice; represent each lattice site i by a triple φi ∈ S 2 . Store
      neighbor differences ∇φ in an interaction-net signature:
                                          Σfield = {αgrad , αcross , αnorm },
      where each symbol corresponds to:
         – αgrad : compute finite difference φi+x̂ − φi , etc.;
                                                       6
         – αcross : compute cross product ∇φ × ∇φ;
         – αnorm : renormalize φ ∈ S 2 .
    • Encode the gauge potential A on edges of the lattice as an integer label mi→j ∈ Z tracking discrete
      winding around a localized hopfion core. The AB holonomy along a closed loop γ becomes
                                                  e X
                                        ∆ϕγ =              mi→j ∆s,
                                                  ℏ
                                                          (i→j)∈γ
      where ∆s is the lattice spacing contribution.
    • Signature swap: replace Lafont’s {α, β, ε} by Σ = Σfield ∪ Σgauge ∪ Σtemplate , including:
         – Σtemplate symbols for local template rewrites generating knot encodings from stretch-fold
           maps;
         – Σgauge symbols for AB update: if two adjacent edges share a hopfion core surface, increment
           the linking counter.
7.2     Parallel Reduction Workflow
    1. Initialization: Seed the lattice with an approximate hopfion configuration φ0 and assign gauge
       labels m0 according to initial flux placement.
    2. Local update kernel: Each GPU thread handles one lattice site i:
         • Use αgrad to compute ∇φi .
         • Use αcross and αnorm to evolve φi by a discretized time step ∆t of the Landau–Lifshitz–Gilbert
           or Faddeev–Skyrme equations:
                                           ∂φ        δE                 δE
                                                                             
                                              = −φ ×    − λφ × φ ×      δφ
                                                                              .
                                           ∂t        δφ
         • Use Σtemplate rewrites to maintain the current knot encoding of UPOs if in a chaotic regime
           by comparing local maxima of velocity norm.
         • Use Σgauge to update mi→j on adjacent edges if φ crosses a threshold indicative of a moving
           hopfion core.
    3. Holonomy accumulation: After each full lattice sweep, collect gauge contributions along selected
       closed loops (e.g., loops around candidate UPO cores) to compute ∆ϕ.
    4. Template extraction: Identify unstable periodic orbits by locating local recurrences in the field
       (∥φi (t + τ ) − φi (t)∥¡ϵ) and reconstruct their knot type via local crossing data on the template
       manifold.
Because each rewrite is local and data-parallel, the HVM2 engine can sustain O(108 ) updates per second
on a single GPU, enabling real-time or near-real-time exploration of knot soliton dynamics, chaotic
itinerancy, and AB holonomies.

      Engineering
8.1     Chiral Macrocycles and Catenanes
Molecules such as [2]-catenanes consist of two interlocked rings. Their topological classification is a
Hopf link (linking number = 1). When each ring supports a delocalized π system, threading a knotted
                                                      7
hopfion-like magnetic flux through one ring induces a gauge phase ∆ϕ = (e/ℏ)Φ, shifting the relative
energy levels of electronic orbitals:
                                                                           e
                                 Ψtot (r1 , r2 ) = Ψ1 (r1 ) Ψ2 (r2 ) e i ℏ Φ Lk(γ1 ,γ2 ) .
By systematically exploring flux placements {Φi } and catenane link configurations, one can optimize
reaction pathways for ring-closing metathesis or flux-gate photocatalysis. Interaction-net simulations in
Bend yield isomerization yield contours in minutes.
8.2     Protein Topology and Enzyme Stabilization
Certain enzymes have disulfide bonds forming knotted loops (e.g., trefoil-knotted methyltransferases).
The folding landscape of such proteins can be parameterized by torsion angles {φk , ψk }N
                                                                                        k=1 , which define
         2N      3
a map R → S . A knotted core yields a nontrivial Hopf index Q. Applying an external nanomagnet
that generates a hopfion-like gauge potential A(r) changes the Berry phase for electron transport during
redox reactions in the active site:
                                                   XN I
                                        γprotein =        A · dr,
                                                           k=1    ℓk
where ℓk tracks electron hopping between residues. By coupling this to molecular dynamics (MD)
on-GPU (encoding dihedral updates in an interaction net), one can screen for mutations that stabilize
the desired knot type while modulating electronic rates.
8.3     DNA Origami and Knot-Controlled Self-Assembly
DNA scaffolds can be folded into programmable shapes using staple strands. To avoid self-intersections,
one can solve a routing problem on a Hopf-fibrational coordinate system:
                           (u, v) ∈ [0, 2π]2 7→ x(u, v), y(u, v), z(u, v) ∈ R3
                                                                         
such that each (u, v) lies on a distinct fiber of the Hopf map h1 : S 3 → S 2 . Interaction-net generation of
candidate embeddings lets one search parameter space for non-intersecting loops. Bend/HVM2 explores
topologies in O(106 ) net rewrites per second, vastly outperforming naive combinatorial backtracking.
8.4     Neural Topological Coding and Chaotic Itinerancy
In recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that exhibit chaotic itinerancy, one can impose an external vector
potential field Aext (r, t) shaped like a hopfion. Model neurons as point-dynamical systems:
                                           X                  e
                             τ V̇i = −Vi +   wij σ(Vj ) + Ii + Φ(t) Lk(γi , Γhopf ),
                                           j
                                                              ℏ
where Γhopf is a closed path in the RNN’s phase space. The AB-type term biases the network to visit a
subset of UPOs (particular memory manifolds). On-GPU simulation via interaction nets (discretizing
voltages and spikes as graph nodes) allows scanning of Φ(t) waveforms that stabilize or destabilize
specific itinerant sequences. This yields a topologically addressable memory register robust against noise
and synaptic drift.
9     Conclusion
The synthesis of:
    1. Interaction nets (local graph rewrites with provable confluence),
    2. ZX-calculus (diagrammatic Hopf algebras for quantum mechanics),
                                                            8
  3. Hopf fibrations (global phase geometry of qubits),
  4. Chaotic attractors and templates (knot-producing dynamical systems),
  5. Aharonov–Bohm holonomies (linking-sensitive quantum phases),
  6. Topological solitons (Hopfions with conserved index Q),
forms a unified topological-computational stack wherein every object—be it a qubit, a knot, a soliton, or
a molecular catenane—is a string diagram in some monoidal category. The Bend/HVM2 engine provides
the operational semantics on GPU, executing millions of local rewrites per second. This framework
enables:
   • High-throughput enumeration and classification of knotted UPOs in chaotic systems;
   • Exact, parallel-in-hardware execution of ZX-diagram rewriting for quantum circuit optimization;
   • Lattice-level simulations of hopfion nucleation, stability, and interactions with charged carriers
     (AB-like effects);
   • Design and screening of chiral macrocycles, knotted proteins, and DNA origami via topological
     coordinates;
   • Exploration of neuromodulation protocols in chaotic RNNs using hopfion-inspired vector potentials.
In essence, any phenomenon reducible to local topological rewrite rules—from quantum phases to
biomolecular conformations—can be embedded in this common GPU-accelerated calculus, delivering
deterministic reproducibility and extreme performance. The geometric invariants (linking numbers, Hopf
indices, Jones polynomials) serve simultaneously as conserved quantities and control knobs, bridging
abstract mathematics with concrete engineering.
