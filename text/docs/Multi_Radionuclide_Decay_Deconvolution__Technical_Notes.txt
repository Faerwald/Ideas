    A mixture containing many radionuclides of different half-lives is best labelled a multi-radionuclide mixture
or radionuclide cocktail. Whether it is an alloy, compound, or composite depends on bonding and microstruc-
ture.
2     Physical Model of the Decay Signal
Let the recorded activity be
                                                   X
                                                   k
                                                                              T1/2,i
                                         N (t) =         Ai e−t/τi ,   τi =          ,
                                                                               ln 2
                                                   i=1
with k radionuclides (k ≤ 20 in the ultimate test), initial activities Ai , and mean-lifetimes τi . The inverse
problem is to recover {Ai , τi } from noisy N (t) samples.
3     Pair-Sampling Algorithm
    1. Random-pair sampling — draw many pairs (ta , Na ), (tb , Nb ) with tb > ta from the measured curve.
                                                                1
    2. Slope → decay constant — for a single exponential
                                                        ln(Nb /Na )          1
                                               λ̂ = −               ,   λ=     .
                                                          t b − ta           τ
      Each pair yields an estimate λ̂.
    3. Histogram / KDE — build a density of λ̂; peaks cluster near the true λi .
    4. Peak picking — convert λi → T1/2,i to seed parameters.
    5. Refined fit — perform nonlinear least-squares on the full sum-of-exponentials model to update (Ai , τi ).
    This Monte-Carlo “pair-spectrum” method trades efficiency for robustness versus classical Prony or Laplace-
inversion techniques.

5     Relevance to Faster-than-Light Information Processing
Accurate in-situ deconvolution of densely populated decay spectra enables a passive, parallel readout channel
whose temporal degrees of freedom encode data at atomic density. Each radionuclide’s decay acts as a clock
tick; the superposition of 20 clocks in one lattice voxel forms a 20-dimensional state. Decoding this under
background noise is the prerequisite for:
    • Ultra-high-density data storage — information mapped onto activity ratios rather than charge states.
    • Virtual causal processing — leveraging known half-lives as a time base for asynchronous logic or
      stochastic resonance computation in radiation-hard or faster-than-light informational architectures.
6     Concise Algorithm Statement
Given a time-series of aggregate radioactive counts N (t) from a multi-radionuclide mixture, repeatedly sample
point pairs, transform each pair into an apparent decay constant, histogram these constants to reveal discrete
peaks at the true λi , and use those peak locations as initial seeds for a global nonlinear fit of the multi-exponential
model, thereby recovering the half-life spectrum and relative activities without prior composition knowledge.
