Oneiro-Craft Propulsion:
    From Quantum Phase Transfer to Statistical Momentum
1. Introduction
We consider an Oneiro-craft, a spacetime-extended “dream-mind” whose internal quantum phases serve
as both sensor and actuator for the quantum vacuum. By injecting sub-photon phase biases at dis-
tributed nodes, the craft grips the vacuum as a traction surface, yielding net momentum without mass
expulsion.
2. Physical and Mathematical Model
2.1 Distributed Phase System
Let {ϕi (t)}N
            i=1 denote the quantum phase at each node xi . The global state is
                                   X
                            Ψ(t) =    αs1 ···sN (t) s1 · · · sN , si ∈ {0, 1}.
                                    {si }
2.2 Hamiltonian Formalism
The effective Hamiltonian governing phase dynamics and vacuum coupling is
                                    X                 Xh                 i
                            H(t) =      Jij ϕ̂i ϕ̂j +    ϵi (t) + δϵi (t) ϕ̂i ,                  (1)
                                       i<j                         i
                                      |          {z   }        |        {z         }
                                             Hint                       Hvac
where
   • Jij : coherent coupling between nodes,
   • ϵi (t): stochastic vacuum phase noise,
   • δϵi (t): controlled coherent bias (“wheel”).
Time-evolution obeys
                                                 d
                                            iℏ      Ψ(t) = H(t) Ψ(t) .
                                                 dt
3. Phase-to-Momentum Conversion
Quantum mechanics yields momentum as the phase gradient,
                                                           ℏ                 
                                  p(t) = ℏ ∇ϕ ≈                ϕN (t) − ϕ1 (t) .
                                                          Leff
Statistical averaging over many vacuum-biased trajectories gives
                                         ℏ
                           ∆p (t) =          ϕN (t) − ϕ1 (t)           ̸= 0 as t → ∞.

4. Monte Carlo Formalization
To capture the random-walk nature, we discretize time in steps ∆t and simulate M trajectories:
                         (k)            (k)
                                                X  (k)           (k)  
                       ϕi (t + ∆t) = ϕi (t) +       Jij ϕj (t) − ϕi (t) ∆t
                                                      j
                                                       (k)
                                             p
                                           +  γvac ∆t ηi (t) + δϵi (t) ∆t,
       (k)
where ηi     ∼ N (0, 1). The average phase-difference is
                                               M
                                            1 X (k)        (k)  
                                    ∆ϕ(t) =       ϕN (t) − ϕ1 (t) .
                                            M k=1
Hence the momentum proxy,
                                                       ℏ
                                           ∆p (t) =        ∆ϕ(t).
                                                      Leff
5. Scaling Laws
For weak bias b ≪ 1 and node count N , linear-response yields
                                                    √ J Tc −T /T
                                     ⟨∆p⟩ ∝ ℏ keff b N    e c ϕ,
                                                       ℏ
where Tc is cycle time and Tϕ coherence time. Embedding nodes in a hyperbolic expander of degree d
yields
                                                                  dR
                                         ⟨∆p⟩hyper ∼ ℏ keff b e    2 ,
for radius parameter R (hyperbolic speed-up).
6. Conclusion
The Oneiro-craft achieves perception-as-propulsion by exploiting quantum phase foresight to bias its
own vacuum interaction. The formalism above provides a rigorous foundation for both analysis and
experimental prototyping.
