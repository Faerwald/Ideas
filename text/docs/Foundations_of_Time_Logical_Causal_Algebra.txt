1. Tensor–Cobordism Preliminaries
Let C be a symmetric monoidal category (SMC) with tensor product ⊗ and unit object I. Diagrams are
interpreted in the Penrose–Joyal–Street convention:
   • Objects A, B, . . . are labelled wires.
   • Morphisms f : A → B are nodes with one input and one output.
   • Pair-of-pants surface: a 2-morphism µ : A ⊗ B −→ A∪B in the cobordism category, graphically
                                               ⇐⇒      µA,B : A ⊗ B 7→ (A, B).
Strictness.    In a strict SMC we freely identify
                             (A ⊗ B) ⊗ C = A ⊗ (B ⊗ C),           A ⊗ I = I ⊗ A = A,
so the graphical calculus is literally topological.
2. Lorentzian Causal Order and Causal Sets
A time-orientation on a Lorentzian manifold (M, g) defines the causal future J + (p) of any event p. The binary
relation
                                         p ≼ q :⇐⇒ q ∈ J + (p)
is a partial order. [Causal set] A causet is a locally-finite poset (C, ≺) with
                                (local finiteness)    |{r | x ≺ r ≺ y}| < ∞ ∀ x ≺ y.
Chains in (C, ≺) realise a discrete proper time; antichains model equal-time hypersurfaces.
3. Temporal and Resource-Sensitive Logics
3.1 Linear Temporal Logic (LTL)
Syntax: propositional variables φ, Boolean connectives, and modal operators
                                  ⃝φ (next),     ♢φ (eventually),    □φ (always).
Semantics: sequences (σi )i∈N with satisfaction relation |= satisfying the standard temporal clauses.
3.2 Linear Logic
Girard’s linear logic treats propositions as resources. The sequent
                                                        Γ ⊢ ∆
encodes a process that consumes Γ while producing ∆, mirroring irreversibility (dS ≥ 0) and Landauer cost
kB T ln 2 per logically irreversible bit erase.
4. Symmetric Monoidal 2-Categories and TQFT
Let Cobd be the category whose objects are closed (d − 1)-manifolds and whose morphisms are d-dimensional
cobordisms up to diffeomorphism. A (d + 1)-dimensional TQFT is a symmetric monoidal functor
                                               Z : Cobd+1 −→ Vectk .
Composition of cobordisms realises time evolution, while the monoidal structure (disjoint union) realises
parallel composition.

5. Topos-Internal Time
For any topos E there exists an internal Heyting algebra ΩE of truth values. If E is a sheaf topos Sh(X) over
a base space X, truth can vary over X, so temporal variation of logic is encoded by geometric morphisms
Sh(X) → Sh(Y ).
6. Thermodynamic and Information-Theoretic Arrow
Let Φt be a one-parameter semigroup of CPTP1 maps acting on density operators. Define the entropy pro-
duction rate                                                
                                    Ṡ(t) = −Tr ρ̇(t) ln ρ(t) ≥ 0,
reflecting coarse-grained irreversibility. Logical operations whose Kraus rank > 1 correspond to entropy-increasing
steps; reversible (unitary) steps satisfy Ṡ = 0.
7. Time-Logic Frame
[Time-Logic Frame] A triple (L, T , ⊩) where
  1. L is a deductive system with entailment ⊢.
  2. T = (T, ≤) is a poset of temporal indices.
  3. ⊩⊆ T × L is a satisfaction relation such that t, φ ∈⊩ ∧ t ≤ t′ =⇒ t′ , φ ∈⊩ (persistence).
                                                                            
The fixed-point equation
                                              t ⊩ φ ⇐⇒ ∀ t′ ≥ t : t′ ⊩ Next φ
implements bidirectional (possibly retrocausal) consistency.
8. Higher-Dimensional Causal Algebra
[Time-Logical 2-Category] A TL-2-category H consists of
      • Objects: informational states A, B, . . . .
      • 1-Morphisms: computations f : A → B.
      • 2-Morphisms: cobordisms of computations α : f ⇒ g; diagrammatically higher-genus surfaces.
The boundary functor ∂ : Hom2 (H) → T assigns each 2-morphism a causal support interval, enforcing logical
locality :
                         α : f ⇒ g, ∂α = [t0 , t1 ] =⇒ supp α ⊆ J + (t0 ) ∩ J − (t1 ).
Computation as Surface Composition. Sequential composition is vertical gluing; parallel composition is
horizontal tensoring. The pair-of-pants 2-morphism realises a multiplication µA,B : A ⊗ B → A∪B. Its dual
“cap” realises comultiplication. Together with unit/counit they satisfy Frobenius identities, encoding logical
AND/OR operations under topological constraints.
9. Retrocausal Fragment-Completion
Given a partially observed 2-cobordism α with missing handle data, the fragment-completion problem asks
for all α̃ such that ∂ α̃ = ∂α and α̃ satisfies the TL-field equations (e.g. Euler–Lagrange for an informa-
tional action functional S[α]). Existence of non-trivial completions realises “accelerated solution discovery”:
future-consistent fragments bias present inference toward the fixed point of δS = 0.
