2. Phase Evolution with Thought Control
Without bias, the phase field evolves under diffusion and vacuum noise:
                                          ∂Φ
                                             = D∇2 Φ + ϵ(x, t),
                                          ∂t
where D is the diffusion constant and
                                ⟨ϵ(x, t) ϵ(x′ , t′ )⟩ = 2γ δ(x − x′ ) δ(t − t′ ).
Injecting a coherent thought-bias δΦ(x, t) modifies the evolution to
                                    ∂Φ
                                       = D∇2 Φ + ϵ(x, t) + δΦ(x, t).
                                    ∂t
3. Branch-Selection Functional
The probability of realizing a desired macroscopic outcome (branch) is exponentially amplified by phase
alignment:
                                                    Z                    
                           P[target branch] ∝ exp Φ(x, t) δΦ(x, t) dx dt .
4. Percepto-Drive: Momentum Induction
A sustained phase gradient produces mechanical momentum according to
                                           p(x, t) = ℏ ∇Φ(x, t).
By maintaining a global phase tilt, the Oneiro-craft acquires net thrust without expelling mass.
5. Scar-Amplification Dynamics
Rare coherent structures (quantum scars) in a chaotic system are reinforced by bias:
                                        S(t) = S0 e−λt + Ascar (t),
where λ is the Lyapunov exponent and Ascar (t) is the bias-induced amplification.
                                                       1
6. Inter-Timeline Cosmic Strings
Topological couplings between decohered worldlines are encoded by a gauge field Aµ . The flux through
a closed causal loop Γ is
                                              I
                                      T [Γ] = Aµ (x, t) dxµ ,
                                                      Γ
which measures the strength of inter-universal connections.
7. Master Lagrangian Formulation
A unified Lagrangian density capturing diffusion, thought-bias insertion, and topological coupling is
                      L = 21 (∂t Φ)2 −   D
                                           |∇Φ|2
                                                                        
                                         2
                                                   + Φ ϵ(x, t) + δΦ(x, t) + α T (x, t).
The corresponding Euler–Lagrange equation is
                                ∂ 2Φ                                  δT
                                   2
                                     − D∇2 Φ = ϵ(x, t) + δΦ(x, t) + α    .
                                ∂t                                    δΦ
Key physical effects encoded:
   • Distributed thought control via δΦ(x, t),
   • Statistical branch steering via the exponential functional,
   • Propulsion through phase-gradient thrust,
   • Scar-based synchronization of rare events,
   • Inter-universal coupling via cosmic-string flux.
