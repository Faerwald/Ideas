  Memory, Imagination, and the Illusion of “Changing the Past”
                                         A Rigorous Perspective
                                               March 6, 2025
                                                    Abstract
         This article revisits and rewrites an earlier science-fiction-oriented paper on the interplay between
     memory, imagination, subjective time loops, and the notion of “changing the past.” While the previ-
     ous version explored these concepts in a speculative or metaphorical manner, here we reframe those
     ideas in more scientifically rigorous terms. We draw on modern neuroscience, mathematics, computa-
     tional modeling, Bayesian inference, quantum mechanics, and engineering practices to illustrate how
     certain phenomena—previously couched as “retrocausality” or “closed timelike loops” in a fictional
     narrative—might be approached using existing scientific and technological frameworks. The goal is
     to preserve the conceptual vision while grounding it in real-world principles, ongoing research, and
     plausible (albeit challenging) engineering proposals.

1     Introduction
The original text painted a picture of an individual who experiences their own memories, daydreams,
or past mental states as fluid and subject to reinterpretation. From this perspective, one might say a
person is “changing the past” each time they recall and recast old events. Although the earlier discussion
was deliberately exploratory and at times reminiscent of science fiction (e.g., references to closed timelike
curves, “wormholes” for memory, and retrocausal quantum effects), we here re-express those themes in
scientific—or at least scientifically inspired—terms.
    Specifically, we address:
    • The reconstructive nature of human memory from a neuroscience and psychology perspective (§2).
    • The role of uncertainty, Bayesian updating, and partial observation in forming or revising beliefs
      about past events (§3).
    • Mathematical and physical formalisms (including quantum analogies and potential references to
      closed timelike curves) that inspire, but do not necessarily prove, a retrocausal viewpoint (§4).
    • Practical engineering or computational approaches that illustrate how memory-based illusions and
      rewriting of historical data might emerge in advanced artificial systems (§5).
    Throughout, we aim to clarify how real experiments, published research, and applied technologies relate
to these ideas. In some sections, we cite known theories and results that provide a baseline for what is
possible given contemporary understanding of physics, computer science, and neuroscience.
2     Neuroscience & Psychology Foundations
2.1    Reconstructive Memory
Contemporary cognitive psychology and neuroscience overwhelmingly demonstrate that memory is recon-
structive rather than a perfect record of past experience [1, 2]. Each recollection requires the brain to
(re)assemble stored traces, integrating new context and potentially altering the memory in the process.
Functional MRI studies indicate substantial overlap between brain regions implicated in episodic memory
and those used for episodic future thinking or imagination [3].
    When individuals recall a specific event, the hippocampal and medial prefrontal areas re-engage neural
networks that are partially reactivated representations of the original encoding. Yet these reactivations can
lose fidelity or gain new details. In experiments on source-monitoring errors, subjects become confused
whether a detail was externally provided or internally fabricated [4]. This phenomenon supports the notion
that what we label as “past truth” is not fully static and can shift with each recall, which in subjective
terms might feel like “rewriting the past.”
2.2    False Memories and Suggestibility
Research on false memory syndrome [5] underlines how social cues, leading questions, or personal motiva-
tions can cause individuals to form strong but inaccurate recollections. Although physically, the historical
facts do not alter, the internal representation does. These changes manifest in verifiable ways (e.g., through
testimony, diaries, or even subsequent behavior). Hence, from a functional standpoint, individuals can ex-
hibit actions consistent with an altered personal history, providing a tangible sense in which “the past has
changed” in their subjective worldview.

3     Information Theory & Bayesian Perspectives
3.1    Bayesian Updating of Past Events
While classical reasoning treats the past as fixed, Bayesian inference allows retrospective updates to beliefs
about past states whenever new evidence emerges [6]. Such “retroactive” Bayesian updates do not literally
rewrite past data, but they change the posterior for what could have occurred. Formally, let X represent
a set of unobserved (or incompletely observed) past variables, and let E represent new evidence acquired
in the present. Bayesian updating modifies p(X|E) relative to the prior p(X) based on p(E|X). If X was
never fully pinned down, then even past events can remain uncertain from the vantage of an observer.
                                                      p(E | X) p(X)
                                        p(X | E) =                  .                                     (1)
                                                          p(E)
   When applied to memory, X could correspond to details about an event that were never encoded or
are subject to interference, and E might be new cues, social influence, or internal emotional states. The
net effect is that an individual’s present mental state retroactively “collapses” or reassigns those uncertain
past details, generating a newly coherent narrative.
3.2    Partial Observation and Constraint Satisfaction
An alternative computational lens is to treat memory as a constraint satisfaction problem. Hard evidence
(like a diary entry) forms constraints, while unrecorded details remain “free variables.” The mind’s inter-
pretive process attempts to find a self-consistent assignment for those free variables that satisfies (or at
least does not contradict) existing constraints. Uncertainty arises because many such assignments might
be plausible, or none perfectly match all constraints. In such a model, rewriting the past occurs when a
new solution is found that retains recorded facts but shifts surrounding inferences to accommodate present
motivations or knowledge.
4     Physical Frameworks & Quantum Analogies
4.1    Closed Timelike Curves (CTCs)
In the fictional narrative, references to “closed timelike curves” (CTCs) evoked the idea of events looping
backward in time. Within real physics, general relativity does not strictly forbid certain spacetimes (like
Gödel or Tipler cylinder solutions) that feature CTCs [7, 8]. However, no known experiments confirm their
physical existence. The Novikov Self-Consistency Principle [9] suggests that if CTCs occur, they must not
allow paradoxes. Thus, physically rewriting macroscopic history remains deeply speculative and beyond
tested science.
    Nevertheless, the mathematical structure of loops can still be used to model feedback or self-referential
processes in computing or cognition. The fictional notion that a future vantage might reshape the past
can be interpreted as a metaphor for self-consistency constraints on memory.
4.2    Quantum Retrocausality
In quantum mechanics, certain interpretations or experimental setups (e.g., the “delayed-choice quantum
eraser” [10]) are sometimes described as retrocausal. However, standard quantum theory (Copenhagen
or Many-Worlds) typically preserves forward causation, and the retrocausal framing is more interpretive
or a statement about how the wavefunction collapses (or doesn’t). Proposed theories of genuine “retro-
causal” quantum mechanics [11] remain outside mainstream acceptance, though they continue to see some
theoretical exploration.
                                                      3
   Applied to memory illusions, one might say that new measurements or new frames of reference can
appear to “rewrite” the outcome of earlier “observations.” But in practice, those earlier observations were
uncertain or entangled with the present vantage in a way that defies simple classical logic. The upshot is
that quantum analogies can be instructive in describing how subjective past events might be re-evaluated,
though it does not literally require exotic physics to do so.
5       Computational Models and Engineering Methods
5.1     Machine Learning and Memory Rewrites
5.1.1    Continual Learning
In artificial neural networks, continual learning methods face catastrophic forgetting [12], meaning new
training data overwrites older representations. If, however, the network preserves or replays older data
selectively (e.g., via experience replay or generative memory models), older knowledge can be updated in
a manner somewhat analogous to rewriting the network’s “past understanding.” This is not literal time
travel, but it captures how an AI might systematically revise prior interpretations to maintain coherence
with new knowledge.
5.1.2    Bayesian Generative Models
Probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) can store “beliefs” about data that is partially observed. When
the system obtains new evidence, it updates the model, including parameters that might retroactively
alter inferences about older data [13]. This approach is widely used in robotics, language modeling, and
advanced analytics. It parallels the Bayesian perspective discussed above, but realized in code.
5.2     Potential Software Tools
Tools like:
    • Pyro or Stan, for building Bayesian generative models.
    • TensorFlow or PyTorch, for neural networks that implement continual learning or memory replay
      modules.
    • LangChain (in the context of large language models), which can store partial chain-of-thought
      prompts and reinterpret them with updated context.
These do not literally let one “reach back in time” but do illustrate how older model states get re-inspected
and re-parameterized in light of new data or goals.
5.3     Data Provenance and Version Control
In real engineering systems, data provenance techniques and version control (e.g., Git) are employed to
track how code or records evolve over time. One can tangibly see older commits and watch them transform
in new branches. If someone merges changes that reinterpret older code or redefines certain functions, you
effectively see a revisionist history in the repository. Though purely metaphorical, it aligns well with the
subjective sense of “changing the past” if older versions are replaced or re-contextualized in the main
development branch.

6     From Fiction to Plausible Realization
6.1    Limits of Physical Retrocausality
Despite the colorful notion of rewriting personal or global history, modern physics provides no demonstra-
tion of genuine backward causation at the macro-scale. While frameworks like Transactionally Interpreted
Quantum Mechanics or retrocausal hidden-variable theories exist in the literature, their acceptance is
limited, and none have been validated to the point of overturning standard forward-in-time causality in
everyday conditions. Hence, physically modifying the content of a person’s diary from a previous year is
beyond any recognized technology.
6.2    Psychological Realism of “Changing the Past”
By contrast, psychologically altering one’s recollection is well within established science. If the past was
never fully pinned down in memory (as evidenced by the reconstructive nature of memory), new interpretive
frameworks can shift entire personal narratives. This is not only possible but common practice in therapy,
eyewitness re-education, and normal emotional coping. The real-world significance is that such changes in
personal or collective memory can alter behavior, mental health, and social identity.
6.3    Practical Methodologies
    • Behavioral Experiments: Testing how easily participants adopt new rationales for old behavior,
      or how false memory illusions are formed under controlled lab conditions.
    • Machine Learning Implementations: Designing multi-agent or multi-session ML frameworks
      where older training data remains partially ambiguous, and new data can retroactively adjust older
      latent variables.
    • Quantum-Like Models of Cognition: Exploring how superposition or entanglement-like formal-
      ism might replicate context-dependent recall, as studied by Busemeyer and Bruza [14].
    Each of these areas bridges the gap between the imaginative, time-loop-based narrative and what is
feasible in present-day psychology, neuroscience, computational modeling, and conceptual physics.
7     Conclusion
Transforming a science-fiction narrative of rewriting personal timelines and “changing the past” into rig-
orous scientific language reveals both the limitations and the surprising plausibility of these ideas. While
actual backwards-in-time causation remains unsupported by current physics, the subjective experience of
altering one’s past is grounded in established neuroscience of reconstructive memory, Bayesian inference,
and the partial unobservability of older events. Quantum analogies and advanced machine-learning models
provide additional frameworks for understanding how new data or interpretations can retroactively alter
one’s mental models.
    In sum, by dissecting a fictional concept into real-world scientific principles, we see that the illusions of
retrocausality are indeed implementable in cognitive, computational, and psychological domains—without
requiring any violation of known physical laws. Such illusions can nonetheless be causally effective in an
individual’s life, changing behavior and self-concept, and thus bridging the realm of metaphorical time
travel with actual scientific and engineering methodologies.
