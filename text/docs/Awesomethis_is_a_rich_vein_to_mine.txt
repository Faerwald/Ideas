Awesome—this is a rich vein to mine. Here’s a compact but complete dossier on Asimov’s Prime Radiant, with
book-canon first (especially Forward the Foundation), then supporting details from the rest of the cycle, and a short
note on the TV variant so we don’t mix canons. I’ve cited the load-bearing claims inline.
What the Prime Radiant is (book canon)
   ●​ A device that stores and displays the psychohistorical equations encoding the Seldon Plan. In operation it
      projects the equations onto room walls and, notably, its light does not cast shadows, allowing viewers to
      stand in front of the projection without occlusion. Control is via the mind: trained users zoom, traverse, and
      amend the math through mental focus. The Plan’s corpus grows over time and is color-coded to distinguish
      base Seldon work from later refinements. (Wikipedia)
Forward the Foundation: everything the novel tells
us or implies
   ●​ Late in life, Seldon works daily with the Radiant while finishing the crisis holograms and pushing the Plan to
      reduce a potential 30,000-year dark age to ~1,000 years; the Encyclopedia Galactica notes he was found at
      his desk with the Radiant active. The novel also has Gaal Dornick inherit Seldon’s own Radiant (implying
      more than one unit existed: Seldon’s personal device and the Second Foundation’s central instrument).
      (BookRags, Wikipedia)​
   ●​ As Seldon identifies mentalics for the nascent Second Foundation, Wanda Seldon detects that a section of
      equations displayed by Yugo Amaryl’s apparatus (i.e., the Radiant) is “wrong,” which is how her talent is
      recognized—linking the Radiant to vetting/quality control of the Plan. (asimov.fandom.com)​
   ●​ At the hand-off to the Second Foundation, Seldon cues Wanda to retrieve the Second Foundation’s location
      from the Radiant (“The Prime Radiant has already told you… Section 33A2D17: Star’s End”), tying the device
      directly to operational knowledge transfer. (Science Fiction & Fantasy Stack Exchange)
How it looks/behaves in operation (from the core
trilogy & Foundation’s Edge)
   ●​ Room-scale, wall-filling projection: two long walls flood with dense equations; users can reduce or increase
      “magnification” to see structure vs detail. The Radiant can “shutter” the view to a chosen time window (e.g., a
      decade) so one can watch the flow of history as the math evolves. (Internet Archive)​
   ●​ No shadows; mind-tuned interaction: a Speaker demonstrates that you can stand before the wall without
      casting a shadow; the Radiant is “attuned to your mind,” and the equations scroll to what the user merely
      thinks of while pointing imprecisely. (This passage also confirms the “light does not radiate… in an ordinary
      manner.”) (Interconnected)​
   ●​ Color semantics (as seen by First Speaker Shandess and Speaker Gendibal):​
           ○​ Seldon Black: original backbone equations.​
           ○​ Speaker Red: later refinements contributed by Speakers.​
           ○​ Deviation Blue: departures/anomalies from the Plan (e.g., the Mule era turns the display into a sea of
              blue).​
              Users toggle macro (“continent-scale”) vs micro views, seeing the interlacing pattern of black and red
               over time. (Internet Archive)​
   ●​ Deviation analysis & policy testing: trainees model hypothetical social/mental manipulations and see
      Deviations explode on the Radiant (e.g., the famous exercise showing how even slight tampering with
      Trantor’s farmers corrupts the Plan). (Internet Archive)​
   ●​ Governance & authorship: by convention, amendments are not personalized; the Radiant is a collective
      artifact. A Speaker explains that corrections are made through “mental rapport” and “there will be nothing
      to indicate that the correction or addition is yours.” (Interconnected)​
   ●​ Scale: observers speak of “acres of equations,” underscoring the Plan’s immensity and the Radiant’s
      navigational affordances. (Wikipedia)​
   ●​ Beyond Seldon: later Speakers extend the Plan past the founding of the Second Empire (the “Hyper-Plan”),
      reinforcing that the Radiant is a living instrument, not a static archive. (Internet Archive)
Where it lives and who uses it
   ●​ Primary custodians: the Second Foundation on Trantor; the Radiant is a core tool for training Speakers and
      steering the Plan. (Wikipedia)​
   ●​ Personal unit(s): Forward the Foundation implies at least one additional, Seldon-held Radiant that he
      worked with privately and bequeathed to Gaal Dornick upon his death. (Wikipedia)
What it is not (avoiding canon drift)
   ●​ The Apple TV+ adaptation reimagines the Radiant as a palm-sized, superposed “puzzle box” with properties
      (e.g., existing in two places, trapping a consciousness) not present in the novels. Treat those as
      show-specific inventions, not Asimov canon. (Wikipedia, corabuhlert.com)
Design principles you can lift for a real-world “Prime
Radiant”
If you want to start from Asimov’s spec and build forward, the canon yields a surprisingly concrete checklist:
   ●​ Semantic layering: base model vs refined layers vs deviation overlays (e.g., Black/Red/Blue) to separate
      fundamentals, expert amendments, and anomalies. (Internet Archive)​
   ●​ Macro↔micro navigation: fast “continent-scale” panoramas with time-window shuttering (e.g., decade
      strides) plus equation-level drill-down. (Internet Archive)​
   ●​ Hands-free control: treat mind control as the UX metaphor—i.e., design for frictionless focus selection
      (gaze/point+intent), minimal UI chrome, and non-occluding display. (Interconnected, Wikipedia)​
   ●​ Anomaly pressure-testing: a sandbox where policy perturbations or exogenous shocks render as
      “Deviation Blue”-style overlays, so users see systemic sensitivity immediately. (Internet Archive)​
   ●​ Collective authorship without ego: changes are tracked and review-gated, but de-personalized in the
      primary view to keep attention on the model, not the modeler. (Interconnected)
If you want, I can translate this into a short technical spec (data model, color semantics, navigation primitives, and a
minimal interaction grammar) that’s faithful to book canon but implementable today.
