The Future Internet Collides with Now
XR vs. MR: Foundational Terms
Extended Reality (XR) is an umbrella term that encompasses all forms of computer-
generated environments that blend the physical and virtual worlds. It includes Aug-
mented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), and Mixed Reality (MR). XR refers to the
entire spectrum of experiences that combine real and virtual elements in various ways.
Mixed Reality (MR), in contrast, is a specific subset of XR. MR involves a deeper
integration where virtual objects not only coexist with the real world but also interact
with it in real-time, often requiring advanced sensors and spatial mapping. Thus, MR is
more specialized than XR, focusing on bidirectional interaction between the physical and
virtual realms within the present context.
Causal Reality (CR) and Virtual Causality (VC)
While XR and MR operate under the assumption that virtual experiences are distinct
from physical reality, new theoretical frameworks suggest a paradigm beyond these def-
initions. Causal Reality (CR) proposes that digital interactions can transcend mere
simulation to actively engage with the past, introducing Virtual Causality (VC)—a
framework where actions in a virtual environment produce verifiable changes in history.
This concept implies that the future Internet does more than store records of past events;
it allows users to rewrite or influence them.
A Concise Vision of the Collision
“In the future, Extended Reality evolves into Causal Reality (CR), where digital inter-
actions do not simulate history but directly engage with it, enabling Virtual Causal-
ity (VC)—a framework where actions in a virtual environment produce real, verifiable
changes in the past. The Future Internet is not just a record of past events; it is an active
system where the present and future intersect with history in a way that allows direct in-
teraction. This is not a simulation or an emulation—it is a functional extension of reality
itself, where the separation between past and future is not a limitation but a structure that
can be engaged, modified, and influenced. Through this system, one can communicate
with individuals in history, just as my future self once reached back to me—proving that
the past is not fixed but, under the right conditions, editable.”
