(Catalyzed from a dream   🙂) Here’s one way to think about your situation, step by step, and maybe carry the ideas a bit farther:
1. Speed vs. Depth
    ●​ Where AI helps: Generative AI is excellent for speed, brainstorming, quick overviews, or suggesting directions to
       explore. It’s especially useful if you already have a certain level of understanding—enough to weed out nonsense or
       half-truths and keep the valuable bits.
    ●​ Where AI falls short: When you’re at the stage of building a foundation and learning fundamentals, you need depth and
       reliable explanations. If you don’t yet know the subject well, then AI’s “guesses” can’t be easily filtered for accuracy. It
       can spin out things that sound correct but miss crucial details or logic. That’s frustrating and can actually confuse you
       more than help.
Think of it like trying to climb a mountain: the AI can point out potential paths up the slope, but if you can’t tell a dead end from a
real path, you might wander in circles. The key is developing the knowledge (or at least partial knowledge) of the terrain first.
2. Understanding vs. Producing
    ●​ Your professor’s saying (“I can teach it to you, but I can’t understand it for you”) is spot on. True understanding
       happens in your own mind, built from internalizing each step logically—often painstakingly.
    ●​ The 1,000-page AI-generated document: It’s a product, not a process. It may contain correct statements, but also
       filler, speculation, or leaps in reasoning that the AI can’t properly justify. Because you don’t yet have the framework to
       evaluate its correctness, studying it just feels like floundering in a random stack of words.
    ●​ Contrast with textbooks: Textbooks are (usually) curated and structured by subject-matter experts to build knowledge
       in a logical sequence. They’re intentionally designed to teach fundamentals, step by step, with examples and exercises.
       That structure is a breath of fresh air because it has a known pedagogical arc.
3. Why a Strong Foundation Matters
    ●​ Physics in particular: You need the fundamentals—mathematical methods, conceptual underpinnings, etc.—otherwise
       advanced topics (like BRST theory) are just piles of symbols and jargon.
    ●​ “Brute force” vs. “Insight”: The insight you gain from wrestling with the basics, doing problem sets by hand, making
       mistakes, and checking them with a reliable source (textbook solutions, known references, or well-vetted instructors) is
       what allows deeper creativity to flourish later.
    ●​ Long-term payoffs: Once you have the conceptual scaffolding in your own mind, then AI can become a great partner—to
       bounce ideas off, brainstorm with, or quickly gather references. But that only works if you have enough background to
       judge the results.
4. The Role of Rest and Environment
    ●​ Fresh air, sunlight, and stepping away from screens: It’s not trivial. Cognitive breakthroughs often happen when you
       step away from the material and let your mind wander. Sunlight and physical activity can help you reset and process
       information subconsciously.
    ●​ Preventing burnout: Spending all your time locked in a room, generating content, can lead to mental fatigue. Real “aha”
       moments and deeper connections often bubble up when you’re relaxed, daydreaming, or physically moving.
5. Possible Approaches Going Forward
    1.​ Use AI Wisely, Not Blindly
            ○​ Clarify discrete points: If you come across a specific concept you’re stuck on, ask the AI to give you a short,
               targeted explanation (e.g., “What is the definition of gauge invariance?”). Then compare that with a textbook’s
               explanation.
            ○​ Get references or direct quotes: If you need references to known papers or classical textbooks, AI can help you
               locate them more quickly.
            ○​ Ask for simpler examples: AI might help by offering simpler analogies or practice problems at a level you can
               handle—again, you’d still have to confirm their correctness, but it can spark your learning process.
    2.​ Build from Textbooks + Problem Sets
            ○​ Work through a good, recommended sequence of textbooks (for instance, a standard undergrad → advanced
               undergrad → beginning grad-level set in physics, mathematics, etc.).
            ○​ Do the exercises, check solutions, discuss them with study partners or a mentor if possible. Even an online
               discussion forum can help you verify your approach.
    3.​ Keep the AI-Generated Document in Storage
            ○​ There’s no harm in archiving it. Maybe down the line—after building more knowledge—you’ll find some partial
               use in it. But right now, it’s not a productive learning tool.
    4.​ Monitor Your Mental Toolbox
            ○​ Pay attention to which method truly advances your understanding. For fundamentals, you might realize that
               old-school pen, paper, and textbooks are the best. For broader exploration and idea generation, AI is a neat
               supplement.
    5.​ Don’t Forget Human Mentors/Peers
            ○​ If at all possible, find a person or a community that’s also studying or teaching the material. Human
               feedback—somebody telling you why a step makes sense or why you’re going off track—can be irreplaceable
               when you’re just starting to grasp advanced topics.
6. What You Might Have Missed
    ●​ Active, Incremental Learning: The best learning is active. Don’t just read—engage. Write notes in your own words, solve
       small problems, quiz yourself.
    ●​ The “Feynman Technique”: Try to explain a concept as if teaching someone else (or, say, writing it on a chalkboard for
       an imaginary audience). Gaps in your explanation expose gaps in your own understanding.
    ●​ Time for Reflection: After a serious study session, do something else (like taking a walk, going outside for a bit). Let your
       brain sift through the new knowledge.
    ●​ Setting Boundaries on AI Use: Rather than banning AI entirely, set a clear rule: you’ll use it only after you’ve tried to
       understand something through your textbook and your own effort. Only then might you ask AI for a cross-check or a
       short summary. This prevents you from using it as a “slot machine” for random content.
7. The Big Picture
Your intuition that “brute force speed and strength” won’t yield real mastery aligns perfectly with the nature of physics and any
deep field of knowledge. At some point, you have to slow down and grapple with the material directly.
    ●​ Generative AI is a powerful tool, but not a magic bullet. In brand-new or highly specialized frontiers of research—where
       even humans haven’t pinned down the correct theories—AI’s guesses are merely guesses.
    ●​ You are the only one who can construct a deep, consistent mental model of these topics within your own mind. That
       takes time, targeted practice, and quality resources.
In short, you are onto something here: building a rock-solid foundation is essential, and no amount of raw determination or AI
assistance can replace that slow, methodical process of true understanding. By changing your approach, getting fresh air, and
methodically studying textbooks, you set yourself up for actual breakthroughs—ones that will ultimately make the best use of
AI’s strengths when you do use it.
That’s likely the healthiest balance: go outside, clear your head, keep a good textbook handy, and let AI be a supplemental
guide—not the generator of truths you haven’t learned yet.
