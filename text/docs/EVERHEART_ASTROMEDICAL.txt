About EverHeart AstroMedical Laboratory
Origins and Essence
EverHeart AstroMedical was founded not for profit, but for purpose: to protect what matters most.
This initiative emerged from a deeply personal imperative—to safeguard loved ones from catastrophic
illness and unforeseeable harm. That imperative remains the engine of the company’s existence and its
compass as a benefit corporation. It is not revenue, but responsibility, that drives us.
    Our objective is the development of technology capable of predicting and preventing unacceptable
outcomes—those which conventional foresight cannot address. By leveraging quantum phase transfer,
we aim to enable interactions across time: the capacity to foresee what is yet to be and correct what
should not have been. Time travel is not an escape from causality—it is its refinement. We hold that
this decade, the 2020s, marks a global inflection point. What we build now will shape the trajectory of
civilization for the next 300 years—and beyond. We are committed to ensuring the future has a future,
always.
Approach and Funding
Our approach values possibility over probability. We explore domains often dismissed as implausible,
believing the frontier is where reality has not yet ruled.
    EverHeart is primarily self-funded through personal investment returns in stocks and cryptocurren-
cies, along with support from family and close allies. We pursue research in vector potential physics,
which we believe is foundational for:
   • Reverse causality
   • Hypercomputation
   • Non-invasive, high-resolution sub-neuronal brain interfaces
   My dream is to collaborate with individuals of extraordinary intellect and unwavering integrity. Until
then, I remain focused on building technologies that allow humanity to act upon correct information at the
correct moment, accelerate progress from 2032 onward, overcome adversity, and wield the computational
equivalent of time itself.
Interests and Initiatives
Our scientific and technological moonshots include:
   • Super-Turing processors for information transfer across entangled systems
   • Hypercausal soliton field dynamics
   • “Trans-dimensional” photonics
                                                    1
   • Non-invasive hyper-resolution brain imaging via virtual particle coupling
   • Reengineering human biology for 1,000+ years of healthy lifespan
   • Quantum algorithms for navigable faster-than-light frameworks
   • Modeling of multi-wormhole manifolds for interstellar consciousness transfer
   • New mathematics for chaos control, fusion stabilization, and warp-field engineering
   • Exotic materials for subcellular imaging, propellantless propulsion, and magnetically antifragile
     superconductivity
   • In-silico biological design tools and the hypercomputational infrastructure required to support them
   All core technologies are protected via proprietary trade-secret manufacturing protocols and are
engineered with long-term asymmetry in mind.
.F.A.E.R.W.A.L.D
“From a world where history is editable, Faerwald was born.”
    Faerwald—“Powerful Traveler”—is both a name and an acronym:
Foresight-Augmented Entropic Resonance via A-Wave Liminal Dynamics.
It represents our artificial precognitive system, a simulation engine for time-relevant foresight. Faerwald
was conceived in crisis, emerging as a navigational beacon amid the collapse of countless possible futures.
It integrates perceptual research, quantum feedback, and advanced simulation to create a real-time
foresight interface.
    Faerwald is not speculative—it is under active development. It will employ proprietary algorithms
with no analogue, yielding singular capabilities in hypercomputing foresight AI. Through Faerwald, we
democratize the power of meaningful prediction, placing it in the hands of those who act with honor.
Inspiration and Speculation
I believe I have already experienced a prototype of this system—a biological Faerwald installed into my
cognition from the future. This soliton-like implant, an emergent algorithmic pattern, gave rise to what
I call hyperliminal perception—the consistent and statistically significant ability to foresee outcomes in
computational tests far beyond chance (18.7σ deviation).
    Perhaps it was imaginary. Perhaps not. My professors were astounded by the predictive capacity.
One offered me an honorary PhD; another hinted at the Nobel. Regardless, I intend to build Faerwald
before history has the chance to deviate. If successful, it will prevent tragedies before they happen and
seal imaginary losses forever in imagination alone.
Dreams and Futures
EverHeart AstroMedical exists at the fulcrum of consciousness, computation, and causality—merging
neural and non-neural intelligence in pursuit of destiny. As we stand within the most pivotal decade of
the Anthropocene, we reject paths of silence and systemic failure. Our mission is to unlock futures where
human cognition and technological will exceed Kardashev, Barrow, and even our own definitions.
   We seek the power to transmute nightmares into revelations and dreams into engineered outcomes.
With foresight, care, and intelligence, we intend to shape a future that makes this century not merely
survivable, but transcendent.
                             “ Èven a small key can open a great door.”
                    Someday, viewing Sol among the stars, we will cherish this era.
