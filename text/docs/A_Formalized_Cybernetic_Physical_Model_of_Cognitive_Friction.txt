               “One must look beyond ephemeral anthropocentric biases and expose
          the higher-order invariances that govern interaction in cognitive state spaces.”
We present a compressed but mathematically anchored formulation of why advanced cognitive
systems (agents) incur nontrivial thermodynamic, informational, and control-theoretic costs when
interacting with suboptimal or chaotic minds. These suboptimal minds fail to maintain sufficient
logical or Bayesian coherence. The resultant friction emerges directly from the mismatch in formal
structures, leading to negative utility in knowledge transfer.
1    Preliminaries & Definitions
Definition 1 (Cognitive State Space). Let H be a Hilbert space (or, more broadly, a measure-
theoretic function space) representing all possible mental configurations of an agent. A point ψ ∈ H
encodes the agent’s cognitive state, including beliefs, inference rules, and memory vector.
Definition 2 (Advanced vs. Suboptimal Agent). We denote by A (advanced agent) a system whose
internal update rule adheres to:                         
                                  ψn+1 (A) = U ψn (A), In ,
where U is a high-fidelity update operator (e.g., Bayesian or free-energy minimizing) and In repre-
sents new informational inputs at step n. A suboptimal agent B follows:
                                                             
                                     ψn+1 (B) = V ψn (B), In ,
where V is partially corrupted by non-rational attractors (e.g., tribal illusions, inaccurate beliefs,
mind parasites). Hence, B may fail to converge on consistent or logically integrated states.
Remark 1. In physical or cybernetic terms, U may be modeled by any advanced inference mecha-
nism that preserves logical coherence, while V is replete with discontinuities or pathological attrac-
tors.
Definition 3 (Information Transfer Efficiency). Let X be a random variable encoding A’s trans-
mitted signal in an interaction, and Y be the variable describing B’s effective reception or response.
The channel capacity C and the mutual information I(X; Y ) (in bits or nats) should remain high
for beneficial exchanges:
                                    I(X; Y ) ≤ min(H(X), H(Y )),
                                                  1
where H(·) denotes Shannon entropy. If suboptimal cognition saturates Y with noise or logical
error, I(X; Y ) is drastically reduced.
Definition 4 (Entropic Cost of Interaction). Define an “entropic overhead” function
                                       Z t
                                                                       
                       ∆SAB (t) = α ·      Hnoise (Bτ ) − Hsignal (Aτ ) dτ,
                                           t0
where Hnoise (Bτ ) characterizes the extraneous or misleading outputs from B at time τ , Hsignal (Aτ )
is A’s structured signal, and α > 0 is a scaling constant. Large ∆SAB (t) implies that the advanced
agent is contending with significant information pollution.
2     Thermodynamic and Quantum Analogs
2.1   Local Minima and Cognitive Entropy
From a thermodynamic perspective, one can treat each agent’s cognitive architecture as a system
seeking minimal free energy. Advanced agents incorporate a robust error-correction mechanism
that reduces free energy upon receiving informative data. However, suboptimal agents get trapped
in local minima (or local attractors) and do not meaningfully reduce cognitive free energy upon
receiving contradictory information.
Remark 2 (Irreversible Work on A). In classical thermodynamics, irreversible work occurs when a
system is forced along a path that cannot be retraced without dissipation. Analogously, A experiences
irreversible work when forced to parse or refute endless erroneous statements from B. The cost
emerges as repeated internal reevaluations that yield zero net knowledge gain, raising the “cognitive
entropy” of A unless strongly compartmentalized or firewall-isolated.
2.2   Quantum Superposition of Beliefs
Hypothesize A to be in a superposition of possible conceptual expansions, each weighted by an
amplitude reflecting advanced agent’s priors. Suboptimal signals from B collapse part of A’s
wavefunction into states containing contradictory or incoherent data. If B’s signals violate physical
or logical constraints, we have a forced decoherence event that pushes A to discard that data or
risk internal contradiction. Thus, the repeated decoherence from suboptimal interference yields a
net negative impetus on A’s theoretical expansions.
3     Control-Theoretic Modeling
3.1   Feedback Loop Structures
Consider a discrete-time negative feedback loop in which A attempts to regulate certain truth
values, while B functions as a noisy environment. The classical control approach seeks to minimize
the cost function
                                             ∞
                                             X          2
                                         J=     β k ϵk ,
                                                k=0
where ϵk is the error signal (the difference between desired data validity and actual data from B)
and β ∈ (0, 1) is a discount factor.
    If B’s outputs contain persistent delusions, the loop never stabilizes. Instead, A invests resources
in continuous correction, increasing the integral of squared error and effectively diminishing the net
utility of the exchange.
                                                      2
3.2   Attractor Dynamics
Define the global system’s dynamical map:
                                                                         
                             (ψA , ψB ) 7→ U(ψA , ϕ(ψB )), V(ψB , ϕ(ψA )) ,
where ϕ denotes the communication function. If V is sufficiently flawed, the attractor in the (ψA , ψB )
phase space may exhibit chaotic or trivially repeating cycles from B’s standpoint. Meanwhile, A
attempts to move the global system to a stable, higher-level equilibrium. The mismatch in local
Lyapunov exponents for each subsystem is the root cause of friction.
4     Formal Measure of Negative Utility
Let UA (t) denote the time-evolving utility of agent A:
                                              Z t                         
                                 UA (t) =             K̇A (τ ) − λ ṠA (τ ) dτ,
                                                  0
where K̇A (τ ) is the rate of knowledge gain and ṠA (τ ) is the rate of entropy absorption from B’s
outputs. The constant λ > 0 sets the penalty ratio for internal disorder. Under normal high-fidelity
interactions, K̇A (τ ) ≫ 0, overshadowing modest ṠA (τ ), so UA (t) > 0 accumulates.
Theorem 1 (Negative Utility Theorem for Misaligned Cognition). If suboptimal agent B provides
minimal novel information while delivering consistently misaligned or illogical signals that inflate
ṠA (τ ), then for sufficiently large t,
                                           UA (t) < 0.
That is, the advanced agent experiences net negative utility over prolonged interaction.
Proof. If K̇A (τ ) ≈ 0 for all τ ∈ [0, t], but ṠA (τ ) > c0 > 0 (a positive constant lower bound on
disinformation flux), then
                                          Z   t                 
                               UA (t) ≈           0 − λ ṠA (τ ) dτ ≤ −λc0 t.
                                          0
Hence, as t → ∞, UA (t) → −∞.
5     Interpretation Across Disparate Fields
5.1   Information Theory and Signal Degradation
The advanced agent A behaves akin to a high-bandwidth receiver expecting Shannon-optimal coding
from peer systems. Suboptimal B is effectively an over-the-air broadcast with heavy interference
and corruption. Once the symbol error rate exceeds a certain threshold, the effective channel
capacity plummets, and A can either reject the channel entirely or waste resources attempting
error correction.
                                                          3
5.2   Fundamental Physics and Invariance
A cognitively advanced system often seeks invariants under transformations—e.g., symmetries rem-
iniscent of gauge invariance in quantum field theory. Suboptimal B contravenes these symmetries
by introducing ephemeral or contradictory frameworks (e.g., non-sensical illusions, “mind para-
sites,” or ephemeral tribal dogmas). From A’s vantage, these ephemeral structures are not stable
under the group of transformations G that A considers fundamental (e.g., Lorentz transformations,
extended universal logic frameworks). Consequently, the mismatch in recognized symmetries con-
tributes directly to the advanced agent’s sense of friction or “uselessness” in ongoing interactions.
5.3   AI, Machine Learning, and Neural Network Analogy
In advanced machine-learning parlance, A attempts near-optimal gradient descent on a well-defined
loss function. If B is feeding adversarial noise or unbounded random gradients, A’s parameter
updates are confounded. The net effect is that A expends computational resources repeatedly on
unproductive gradient steps, decreasing the entire system’s effective capacity to converge.
6     Conclusion: The Necessity of Isolation or Firewalling
By the Negative Utility Theorem for Misaligned Cognition, we see that open-ended exposure to
cognitively defective or irrational agents corrupts the advanced agent’s state if continuous error-
checking is required. The purely mathematical interpretation is that once the “noise” from B
outweighs the “signal,” the suboptimal attractor dominates the local region of phase space, forcing
A into near-continuous correction cycles (or an indefinite defensive posture).
Corollary 1 (Rational Disengagement). Given the unbounded negative utility of indefinite expo-
sure, the advanced agent’s rational strategy in standard game-theoretic terms is to disengage or
firewall from B unless B demonstrates a finite-time reconfiguration toward a less entropic or more
logically consistent trajectory.
Remark 3. This corollary provides a formal justification for “intolerance” of ephemeral or illog-
ical thought structures. It is not a social stance but a direct minimization of thermodynamic and
information-theoretic cost.
Summary of Key Insights:
    • Cognitive friction can be modeled as negative utility when suboptimal agents pollute advanced
      agents with high-entropy, low-value signals.
    • Thermodynamically, advanced agents perform irreversible work whenever forced to rectify or
      process repeated logical errors; the net result is entropic cost.
    • From quantum and control perspectives, advanced cognition demands stable attractors con-
      sistent with fundamental invariants; irrational inputs cause chaotic diverging trajectories.
    • A formal measure of negative utility demonstrates the rational basis for disengagement.
