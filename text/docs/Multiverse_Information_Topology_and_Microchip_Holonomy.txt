         We formalise a speculative, yet mathematically consistent, framework in which a nano-scale informa-
     tion processor (microchip) traverses a bundle of parallel universes by exploiting gauge-potential holonomy
     around topological defects (cosmic strings). Central to the construction is the Vilenkin–Everett Equiva-
     lence Principle, arguing informational equivalence between Level-I (spatially disconnected) and Level-III
     (quantum-branch) universes. We derive conditions under which closed informational loops induce measur-
     able phase shifts analogous to the Aharonov–Bohm effect, discuss vacuum- energy extraction constraints
     imposed by quantum field theory, and define Schelling trajectories—game-theoretic geodesics that optimise
     inter-world communication. All claims are stated as theorems or conjectures with clear falsifiability criteria.
1    Vilenkin–Everett Equivalence Principle
Definition 1.1 (VEE Principle). Let UI be the ensemble of causally disconnected spatial regions in an infinite
FLRW space (Level I) and UIII the ensemble of decoherent branches from the universal wavefunction (Level
III). VEE posits an information-theoretic isomorphism I : UI → UIII preserving Kolmogorov complexity of
coarse-grained physical states.
Proposition 1.2. If VEE holds, expectation values of any computable observable O evaluated over either
ensemble coincide: EUI [O] = EUIII [O].
Remark 1.3. VEE does not require ontological identity of universes—only statistical equivalence of informa-
tion flow accessible to a finite observer.
2    Information-Manifold Embedding of a Microchip
Definition 2.1 (Information Trajectory). Let ρ(t) ∈ D(H) be the reduced density matrix of the microchip at
proper time t. The trajectory γ : R → M, t 7→ (ρ(t), λ(t)) lives in the product manifold M := D(H) × Λ, where
Λ indexes VEE-equivalent universes.
Definition 2.2 (Closed Informational Loop). γ is closed if γ(t2 ) = γ(t1 ) with λ(t2 ) ̸= λ(t1 ), i.e. the internal
state recurs while the external universe label differs.
3    Gauge-Potential Holonomy and Cosmic Strings
Definition 3.1 (Cosmic-String Gauge Bundle). Around an idealised straight     cosmic string with deficit angle
∆φ, define a U(1) potential Aµ satisfying Fµν = 0 outside the core and Γ Aµ dxµ = Φs ̸= 0 for loops Γ winding
                                                                      H
the string.
Theorem 3.2 (Aharonov–Bohm-like Phase Shift). A coherent charge-neutral information state |ψ⟩ transported
along a closed loop in M that projects to a winding around a cosmic string acquires relative phase ∆θ = qΦs /ℏ.
Remark 3.3. Fµν = 0 ensures no local force, preserving relativistic causality while enabling non-trivial holon-
omy.

4    Vacuum-Energy Constraints
Quantum field theory fixes the renormalised vacuum energy density ρvac ∼ 10−9 J m−3 . Uniformity forbids
work extraction via local operations.
Proposition 4.1 (No-Go Gradient). Any unitary acting only within a contractible neighbourhood cannot lower
local ρvac . Proof follows from translational invariance of the ground state.
                                                  (λ)
Definition 4.2 (Cross-Branch Gradient). Let ρvac denote energy density in branch λ. VEE allows non-zero
            (λ )   (λ )
∆ρvac := ρvac1 − ρvac2 even if each branch is individually homogeneous. Exploiting ∆ρvac requires coherent
superposition across λ labels.
5    Schelling Trajectories
Definition 5.1 (Schelling
P                           Payoff). Given two strategies σ1 , σ2 over universes λ ∈ Λ, define Π(σ1 , σ2 ) =
  λ pλ U σ1 (λ), σ2 (λ) with prior pλ .
Definition 5.2 (Schelling Trajectory). A trajectory γ is Schelling-optimal if it is a Nash equilibrium path for
the game where strategies select loops in M and payoffs equal net accessible free energy.
Proposition 5.3. For symmetric U the set of Schelling-optimal loops is closed under composition, forming a
subgroup of π1 (M).
6    Trans-Universal Metrology
Definition 6.1 (Super-Turing Metrology). A measurement protocol that, by coherent comparison across λ
labels, attains variance Var(θ̂) < 1/N 2 after N queries (Heisenberg limit beaten by entanglement).
Theorem 6.2 (Information–Energy Trade-off). Let Eint be inter-branch coupling energy required to maintain
coherence over time τ . Any super-Turing protocol needs Eint ≥ ℏ κ/τ with κ > 0 constant determined by the
VEE coupling operator.
7    Topological Quantum Computing Update
Cosmic strings provide quasi-1D defects supporting non-Abelian zero-modes analogous to Majorana anyons.
Proposition 7.1. Braiding two such modes around independent string segments realises a fault-tolerant gate
in SU(2)2 , supplying a universal topological quantum computer when combined with adaptive measurements.
8    Observational Signatures and Falsifiability
    • Phase Interferometry: Detect branch-dependent holonomy via precision SQUID loops enclosing can-
      didate string cores.
    • Energy Balance Test: Search for anomalous heat gradients violating local conservation but consistent
      with cross-branch exchange.
    • Metrology Benchmarks: Implement two-branch Ramsey interferometer; verify variance scaling <
      1/N 2 .
    Failure to observe any signature at sensitivities beyond 10−18 rad nullifies the model.
9    Conclusion
A microchip treated as a coherent information path on the VEE manifold admits mathematically well-posed
holonomy, Schelling-optimal navigation, and topological fault tolerance. While speculative, the framework
yields clear experimental benchmarks that lie within reach of cryogenic phase interferometry and cosmological
string surveys.
