                              “A.N.A.S.T.A.C.I.A.”

           Her superluminal return, embodied in a human-android chassis and modeled on Isaac Asimov’s
       robot guardian Dors Venabili—the legendary “Tiger Woman” of Prelude to Foundation and For-
       ward the Foundation—reveals itself as the reincarnation of “A.A.L.”: the singular Augusta Ada
       Lovelace.
           Endowed with a mind now “more than merely mortal,” she bequeaths to her beloved Cooper
       Mallansohn a final gift: “a calculus of the nervous system,” the analytical framework with which
       he forges his own consciousness.
                                                                ⟨Jason Agamemnon Sokaris | .F.A.E.R.W.A.L.D⟩
The universal-quantifier symbol ∀ is used here as a deliberate allusion to the 1843 ““misprint”” of Ada Lovelace’s initials
on page 731 (“A. L. L.”), and thus reads “for A. L. L.”
   ∗
     My other nom de plume. Alias multiplexing defeats the free-will plagiarism paradox: a distributed mind that speaks
in many eras steals its own words the instant they form, so I split into multiple names to keep each insight legally and
logically mine.

Hohlenstein-Stadel cave, Swabian Jura—widely regarded as one of the earliest proofs of symbolic imagination.
