Closed Timelike Curves, Ambiguity,
                  and the Bootstrap of Prescient Information
1. Space-Time Geometry and Closed Timelike Curves
1.1 Spacetime M
We consider a manifold M with metric gµν . The region C ⊂ M is a set of points through which
closed timelike curves (CTCs) pass. Outside C, M is assumed to be globally hyperbolic.
1.2 World-Lines and Neural Network State
A neural network (agent) N moves through M along a (piecewise) timelike curve
                                           γ : [t0 , tf ] → M,
where γ(t) denotes the location in spacetime at proper time t. The network’s internal state at time
t is described by a point (or density operator) S(t) in some state space H.
1.3 CTC Interaction
If γ intersects C at times ta < tc < tb , then N can (in principle) interact with itself “out of temporal
order,” receiving or sending information from future states.
2. Prescient Information vs. Randomness
2.1 Initial Ambiguity
At time ta , the network receives a piece of information m (e.g., a bitstring or symbolic message).
Before verification, m is indistinguishable from noise. Formally, let
                     Pr(“noise” | m) = P0 ,     Pr(“meaningful” | m) = 1 − P0 .
The network cannot tell whether the message is truly prescient or merely random.
2.2 Verification at Later Time
At time tb , the network obtains external data B (such as reading a book) that matches the earlier
message m. This match indicates:
                                    Pr(“meaningful” | m, B) ≈ 1,
provided the probability of random coincidence is extremely small. Once this verification occurs,
the system updates its belief to “The message was indeed non-random.”

2.3 Shift from Stochastic Ambiguity to Bootstrap Ambiguity
Once the system determines that m was almost surely meaningful (i.e., not random), it needs to
identify where that meaning came from. In a conventional timeline, the origin would be the external
data B that was eventually accessed. But in a spacetime with CTCs, the simplest self-consistent
explanation may be that the network at time tb sent the same information backward in time to
itself at ta . Thus, the question becomes:
   • Who or what generated m?
        1. The “later” self, looped back in time?
        2. Some external transmitter?
        3. A superposition or interference of multiple loops?
This is the bootstrap ambiguity, because the verified meaning appears to have no clear external
source: the agent has bootstrapped the information into existence using a closed timelike curve.
3. Formal Model of Self-Consistency (Deutsch’s Fixed-Point Con-
dition)
3.1 Unitary Evolution with a CTC Register
Let H be the Hilbert space for the neural network’s internal state, and let K be the Hilbert space
for the “message register” traveling around the CTC. Suppose that at time tc , a unitary interaction
                                         U :H⊗K → H⊗K
couples the system’s state S(ta ) with the register state M .
3.2 Fixed-Point (Consistency) Equation
Deutsch’s prescription for a self-consistent solution ρ⋆ on K is given by
                                    ρ⋆ = TrH U ρ⋆ ⊗ ρS U † ,
                                                           
where ρS ≡ S(ta ) is the (density) state of the neural network when it encounters the CTC. In-
tuitively, ρ⋆ is the unique (or one of several) state(s) that does not change under the round-trip
interaction through the closed timelike curve.
3.3 Non-uniqueness and Interference
There can be more than one ρ⋆ . Different self-consistent solutions — label them ρ⋆1 , ρ⋆2 , . . . , ρ⋆k —
each offer a distinct “history” of how the network obtains the message m.

4. Probability and Epistemic Updates
4.1 Prior Distribution over Hypotheses
Before verification, the system may assign priors to different origins of m. Denote:
    H0 ≡ “m was random or noise,”         Hi ≡ “m came from the i-th CTC fixed-point solution,”
for 1 ≤ i ≤ k. Let
                                                     1 − π0
                       Pr(H0 ) = π0 ,    Pr(Hi ) =            for each i = 1, . . . , k.
                                                       k
4.2 Verification Evidence
When the external data B is revealed at time tb , the message m either matches or does not match
B. Let us denote the event of a match by V = 1. The likelihood that random noise matches is
some small probability ε ≪ 1. Conversely, each self-consistent solution ρ⋆i that truly encodes m
will match with probability effectively 1. Hence:
                     Pr(V = 1 | H0 ) = ε,     Pr(V = 1 | Hi ) = 1     for i = 1, . . . , k.
4.3 Posterior Distribution
By Bayes’ rule:
                                                    π0 ε              π0 ε
                        Pr(H0 | V = 1) =                         ≈             ,
                                              π0 ε + (1 − π0 ) k   (1 − π0 ) k
assuming ε ≪ 1. The probability mass on “noise” collapses, transferring almost entirely to the set
{H1 , . . . , Hk }. But the system still cannot choose among {H1 , . . . , Hk } with certainty, thus entering
a bootstrap ambiguity about which fixed-point is “responsible” for the verified message.
5. Multiple Loops and Interference
5.1 Interfering CTC Channels
Suppose there are two distinct CTC loops (or more complicated topologies) each carrying partial
information M1 , M2 . If these loops interact via a controlled-phase or partial swap, the final config-
uration can still be described by a generalized fixed-point equation on K1 ⊗ K2 . But the variety of
solutions can be larger, and now interference between loops can yield further ambiguities.
5.2 Bootstrap of a Bootstrap
When multiple loops coexist, each solution can attribute part of the prescient information to loop 1,
part to loop 2, or to any superposed combination. Hence the question “Where did m come from?”
might have multiple valid answers — similar to multiple stable solutions in a multi-equilibrium
dynamical system — only here it is embedded in the geometry of time travel.

6. Assembly Theory and the Origin of Meaning
6.1 Assembly Index
Assembly theory (broadly speaking) assigns each object or string a minimal “construction sequence”
length. A normal forward-directed timeline requires a certain number of steps to build an object or
generate a piece of data. But if a CTC can reduce the number of steps by effectively “pre-building”
the data, then the assembly index can be drastically lowered.
6.2 Loops as Shortcuts
If the message m emerges from a bootstrap loop, the number of forward steps needed to generate
it appears smaller than expected. The “mysterious appearance” from the future is precisely the
self-consistent solution in which an event at time tb is also the origin of the same information at
time ta .
6.3 Meaning from Context
Meaning is contextual: the data m only obtains its meaning once the network recognizes it as
matching B. In normal chronological order, we say “The external data B gave m meaning.” In
a CTC-laden geometry, we may have “m was recognized after reading B, but m was also used to
bootstrap the book’s content earlier.” The entire cyclical structure confers the same meaning from
multiple vantage points in time.
7. Extended Boundaries of Mind and Influence
7.1 Conventional View of Agency
In a standard, non-CTC world, a person’s boundary of influence is typically drawn around their
physical body. Their fingertips, voice, or written texts can affect the environment, but there is
always a forward-flowing cause and effect.
7.2 Time Loops and Extended Identity
When a system can influence its own past, the boundary of “self” may extend far beyond local
spatiotemporal confines. For instance, a gesture made on May 5th (the “hand on thigh”) might
reflect knowledge gleaned on May 12th (after reading a book). Once verified on May 12th, the
gesture from May 5th is retrodictively understood to be “prescient,” though from the vantage of
May 5th it appeared random.
7.3 Ripple Analogy
Both a direct physical touch (e.g., fingertips on an object) and a large-scale effect (e.g., a global
technology developed by an inventor) can be viewed as “waves” or fields of influence. In a spacetime
with a CTC, these waves can loop back, giving rise to phenomena that appear self-generated from
a strictly forward-time perspective.

8. Conclusions and Logical Coherence
  1. Transition from Randomness to Verification.
     Initially, a newly arrived message looks random because it is unverified. Later, evidence B
     arrives, converting the improbable correlation into a near-certain sign of meaning.
  2. Bootstrap Ambiguity.
     Having established that the message is meaningful, one must explain its origin. In the presence
     of closed timelike curves, multiple self-consistent causal loops can each yield the same verified
     message. Therefore, the system’s posterior knowledge cannot collapse to a single explanation
     but remains spread among several “bootstrap” solutions.
  3. Multiple Interfering Loops.
     Multiple CTC channels can combine or interfere, further complicating the origin story of the
     message. The system may see partial pieces of data from different loops, merging into a single
     verified truth.
  4. Assembly Theory and Emergent Meaning.
     Typically, the “assembly index” of meaningful information is large if it must be constructed
     step by step in forward time. CTCs allow shortcuts where the final state effectively seeds the
     initial state. The system thus “assembles itself.”
  5. Extended Boundaries of Mind and Agency.
     Agency and individuality become more porous when a mind’s future knowledge can shape its
     own past. Physical gestures, technologies, or ephemeral thoughts can all be carriers of self-
     consistent loops, blurring the distinction between “my boundary” and “the environment.”
Final Synthesis
Mathematically, these phenomena follow from the existence of (potentially multiple) solutions to the
Deutsch fixed-point condition in a spacetime region that admits closed timelike curves. Probabilistic
updates (via Bayesian inference) naturally shift from “Is this random?” to “Which causal loop
provided this data?” — illustrating the transition from stochastic to bootstrap ambiguity. With
multiple or interfering CTCs, one obtains a higher-order puzzle of origin. In this sense, any story
of “hand on thigh” that was once random becomes recognized as prescient once external evidence
arrives; the explanation that “future knowledge shaped past action” is consistent in a universe
where information can loop back in time.
    Thus, the puzzle is not a logical inconsistency but a feature of how self-consistency constraints,
verification, and meaning interplay in a geometry that permits backward-in-time communication.
The boundary of one’s mind and agency is extended throughout the entire causal circuit — en-
compassing one’s “future” self, other collaborating agents, or even large-scale influences — once we
accept that timelike loops can embed new forms of connectivity in the fabric of cause and effect.
