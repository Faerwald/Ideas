Below is a conceptual way of thinking about the “dimensionality” or “intrinsic dimension” of language,
mathematics, and physical theories, along with some remarks on whether (and how) “engineering” new
languages might surpass certain thresholds. Note that these ideas are quite speculative; researchers use terms
like “dimension” in many different ways (from the strict geometric meaning to more loose, metaphorical
senses).
1. What do we mean by the “intrinsic dimension” of a language?
In mathematics and machine learning, the intrinsic dimension of a dataset (or a manifold on which the data lie)
is basically the smallest number of coordinates needed to describe its variability without “losing information.”
For example:
   ●​ In a 3D video of a single spinning cube, the actual degrees of freedom are fewer than all the raw pixel
      values; effectively, the data lie on a manifold with far fewer degrees of freedom than the raw dimension
      of the input space.
   ●​ In natural language processing (NLP), large language models embed words or sentences in a
      high-dimensional vector space (hundreds or thousands of dimensions). But due to correlations and
      structure, the set of all “valid sentences” usually clusters in a lower-dimensional region within that huge
      space.
When people try to measure the intrinsic dimension of language empirically, they typically do something like:
   1.​ Take a large set of text (a corpus).
   2.​ Embed it in a high-dimensional space (e.g. with a model).
   3.​ Estimate how many dimensions you need to capture most of the variance (using something like PCA or
       more sophisticated manifold-learning techniques).
It’s not unusual to find that the effective dimension can be in the tens, hundreds, or sometimes into the low
thousands—depending on the dataset, model, or method of measurement. If you see claims like “42,” that’s
more of a symbolic or humorous reference (Douglas Adams’s “Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, The
Universe, and Everything”). There is no universal consensus number for “English is 42-dimensional” or
“300-dimensional.” Rather, think of it as: English has a large apparent dimension in raw text space, but a more
modest, though still substantial, “intrinsic dimension” in the manifold sense.
Compare to mathematics or programming languages
   ●​ Mathematical language can be more constrained and symbolically consistent than everyday language:
      fewer ambiguities and more rigid rules. So if you look only at “valid symbolic expressions” in
      mathematics, that might form a narrower manifold than the entire range of everyday English usage. In
      that sense, you might say “mathematics” has a smaller or at least more structured manifold.
   ●​ Programming languages are often even tighter in syntax (they won’t compile if you deviate from the
      formal grammar). So from the standpoint of “what typical code looks like,” you often find an even more
      constrained distribution.
However, these comparisons are somewhat fuzzy: you can always layer in more complexity, e.g., mathematics
can express infinitely many statements. The real point is that natural languages are sprawling and ambiguous,
while formal languages are more carefully curated to reduce redundancy and ambiguity.
2. Can “engineering a language” help us surpass certain thresholds or
barriers?
You wondered if constructing or engineering a new language—one that captures ideas in a higher-level or more
systematic way—could “boost intelligence” or break certain thresholds of reasoning. Some points to consider:
   1.​ Sapir–Whorf hypothesis / linguistic relativity​
        This is the (somewhat debated) idea that your language can shape how you think—at least in subtle
       ways, it can prime or bias certain conceptual categories. So in principle, a language that’s designed to
       highlight or simplify particular conceptual distinctions might help speakers be faster or more consistent
       in certain mental tasks.​
   2.​ Notation in mathematics​
        There is real evidence in the history of mathematics that better notation (e.g., algebraic notation, vector
       calculus notation, Feynman’s diagrams) can drastically speed up discovery, reduce errors, and enable
       conceptual leaps. So it’s not purely hypothetical that certain formal systems or languages can “push”
       cognitive or creative breakthroughs.​
   3.​ Formalizing new ideas​
        In fields like computer science, new “domain-specific languages” (DSLs) can allow extremely concise
       expression of ideas that would be unwieldy in a more general language. That can be seen as raising the
       level of abstraction and letting you solve bigger problems with less mental overhead.​
So yes, engineered languages or specialized notations really can break certain “barriers” of complexity or
clarity. There is some synergy, though, between the language itself and the mind using it. If the mind isn’t
already able to conceptualize those distinctions, or if the context doesn’t encourage the new approach, then a
new language alone might not yield leaps.
3. Is there a known lower limit to the dimension of language?
   ●​ Strictly speaking, we don’t know a “lowest dimension” for all possible languages. It’s certainly not as
      simple as “4D because we live in 3+1 spacetime.” The dimension of human languages is more about
      neural and cultural constraints than about fundamental physics.
   ●​ Our brains are massively high-dimensional systems, and our human languages reflect messy, multi-scale
      patterns grown over millennia. It’s hard to define a neat, minimal “underlying dimension” of everything
      humans say.
On the other hand, if you want to tie it to fundamental physics: yes, the entire universe might be 3+1
dimensional (or 10, or 26, if you believe certain string theories). But that’s a different usage of “dimension.” It’s
about geometry of spacetime, not about degrees of freedom in a neural or linguistic manifold.
In general:
   ●​ Language dimension (in the sense of machine-learning or manifold geometry) is large and messy,
      definitely >>4.
   ●​ Physical spacetime dimension (3+1 or more, if you count extra compactified string dimensions) is about
      geometry, not about the combinatorial structure of messages.
4. The idea that natural laws themselves are “already optimized”
You mentioned that maybe “nature’s language” is minimal or “already optimized,” so we can’t go lower than
3+1 or something along those lines. One way to interpret that is:
   ●​ Nature can be described by the minimal set of equations (or principle of least action, or quantum field
      theories) that end up being “the simplest rules that generate our observed phenomena.”
   ●​ Human language is far from minimal. It’s built for convenience, social use, cultural evolution, and
      doesn’t necessarily reflect a tight minimal grammar for describing reality.
Could we discover or harness “nature’s own language” to do better at intelligence? That verges on a more
metaphysical or philosophical line of thought. In physics, mathematicians often marvel at the “unreasonable
effectiveness” of mathematics in describing physical reality. Maybe you could see mathematics (or future
modifications of it) as an attempt to get closer to that minimal descriptive system.
5. Could the language you speak affect your intelligence?
In small but definite ways, yes:
   ●​ Certain linguistic structures (like how a language handles number words, or how it marks tense/aspect)
      can give slight advantages or disadvantages in conceptual tasks.
   ●​ More powerful or well-chosen notations and mental representations (e.g., “high-level math notation” or
      certain programming paradigms) definitely help people solve complex problems more quickly and with
      fewer errors.
But we shouldn’t think it’s a magic bullet. If a language is too abstract or too contrived, humans might find it
harder to learn and effectively use. Good engineered languages often have a sweet spot:​
 (a) Enough abstraction to compress complex thoughts.​
 (b) Enough “human compatibility” that it’s learnable and cognitively comfortable.
6. Tying back to neural scaling laws and “transcending” thresholds
Modern large-scale deep learning suggests certain scaling laws: as you increase model size (parameters),
training data, and compute, performance on tasks tends to follow somewhat predictable power-law curves. But
at any given scale, you might see diminishing returns. Some researchers wonder if new architectures, new forms
of data, or new ways of representation might break the current “scaling curves” and yield leaps in capability
(maybe that’s the “transcending” you mentioned).
Could a new language or representation break the scaling law plateau?
Potentially. If a model is trained on a much simpler or more revealing representation of the underlying concepts,
then the model might learn faster and generalize better than if it’s stuck with a noisy or ambiguous
representation. This is akin to how we do better in math class when we have a crisp, consistent notation for
geometry or algebra, compared to wordy, confusing statements.
7. Attempting to interpret your big-picture question
You’ve connected:
   ●​   The manifold dimension of natural language (which is intangible but definitely more than a few).
   ●​   The manifold dimension of mathematics (possibly narrower and more structured).
   ●​   The fundamental 3+1 (or more) dimensions of the universe.
   ●​   The possibility that “nature’s language” or an engineered language might help us surpass thresholds of
        understanding.
A way to see it:
   1.​ Data dimension vs. physical dimension: The “dimension” in manifold learning for language is about
       how complicated the patterns in language corpora are. This is quite separate from how many physical or
       string-theoretic dimensions exist in nature.
   2.​ Threshold or barrier: If you’re talking about a neural scaling law barrier (like “I keep pumping more
       parameters or more data, but I can’t achieve some level of performance”), maybe a drastically more
       structured or revealing form of input—i.e., an “engineered language”—could help. Essentially you’ve
       done a “feature transformation” that flattens or simplifies the data manifold.
   3.​ Nature’s own language: Sometimes mathematicians or physicists talk about how the universe “really”
       runs on Lagrangians and Hamiltonians and wavefunctions. In principle, that’s highly compact. But
       bridging it to the complexities of everyday human problems is nontrivial.
   4.​ Language changing intelligence: The language we use frames how quickly we can represent new
       concepts, pass them around, and reason about them. So yes, it can matter for intelligence. But it’s not the
       only factor.
Final Thoughts
   ●​ Dimensionality in the sense of data manifolds is an abstract concept that can illuminate why certain
      high-dimensional signals (like all sentences in English) still lie on a structure that might be spanned
      effectively by fewer dimensions.
   ●​ Mathematical / coding languages generally impose tighter constraints, so their “manifolds” might be
      smaller, making them more powerful for certain tasks (like reliability or unambiguous expression).
   ●​ Engineered languages (including formal notations) can indeed help humans reason or help AI learn.
      They can “break barriers” if they simplify the representation, reduce ambiguity, or highlight the core
      structure.
   ●​ There is no firm, universal “lower limit” of the dimension of language in a cosmic sense. The 3+1
      dimensions of spacetime (or 10, 11, 26 in string theories) are about the geometry of physics, not about
      the dimension of conceptual or linguistic spaces.
   ●​ Our best example of how “better notation” can revolutionize thinking is mathematics: from Babylonian
      numerals to symbolic algebra to modern frameworks, each shift can open new realms of possibility. It’s
      plausible similar leaps can happen if we find a new “language” that better fits certain domains.
I hope this helps clarify the different ways “dimension” is used—and how the question of “can we transcend
some barrier by changing our language?” can be answered both with real-world historical examples (yes,
sometimes) and with caution (there’s no simple universal threshold that a new language automatically breaks).
If you’re feeling that your ideas here are “chaotic” or “not fully formed,” that’s actually quite normal when
grappling with topics that blend physics, linguistics, machine learning, and philosophy. The main takeaway is:
language is powerful, but it’s not purely limited by 3+1D spacetime in a literal sense; its “dimension” is about
conceptual degrees of freedom, which we can sometimes reorganize to see things in new ways.
