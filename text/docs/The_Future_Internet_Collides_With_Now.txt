1     Introduction and Fundamental Conceptualization
The convergence of emergent computational paradigms, quantum informatics, and advanced relativistic
concepts suggests the imminent collision of the future internet with the contemporary world. We posit
that the future internet will not merely evolve in complexity, but fundamentally reshape spatiotemporal
interactions via quantum, relativistic, and cybernetic mechanisms. This paper articulates a comprehensive
theoretical framework for such an internet, inspired by established concepts such as quantum scars, dy-
namical Casimir effects, transactional and many-worlds interpretations, and exotic gauge field constructs
including vector potential (A-fields) physics.
2     Core Theoretical Principles
2.1    Quantum-Scar Wormhole Analogy
Quantum scars emerge in classically chaotic quantum systems as anomalously stable eigenstates, acting as
coherent, information-preserving islands within a chaotic Hilbert-space evolution. Analogously, we propose
viewing individual conscious minds as ”quantum scars,” each maintaining structured quantum coherence
against environmental decoherence. The human brain dynamically imposes quantum boundary conditions,
stabilizing specific quantum eigenstates and enabling persistent quantum cognitive attractors analogous to
neural attractors.
   Formally, we propose a Hilbert-space boundary operator:
                                            B[A(x, t)]Σ(t) = 0,                                        (1)
where Σ(t) represents dynamic neural tissue boundary conditions and A represents quantum field config-
urations (vector potentials, etc.). These dynamically evolving neural structures induce stable quantum
eigenstates (quantum scars) satisfying:
                                        H[Σ(t)]ψscar = Escar ψscar .                                   (2)
3     Quantum Informational Wormholes
Traditional spacetime wormholes in general relativity are topological channels connecting distant regions
of spacetime. By analogy, we explore informational wormholes as structured quantum channels enabling
superluminal-like correlations across decohered branches or times. Quantum field nonlinearities, photon-
photon interactions, and vacuum polarization allow nonlinear quantum electrodynamic scenarios that
deviate from linear Maxwellian frameworks. These non-Maxwellian electromagnetic effects—such as in-
tense fields inducing vacuum polarization—might create stable localized quantum channels (”informational
wormholes”) through vacuum fluctuations.
                                                     1
  Mathematically, these wormhole structures arise through nonlinear extensions of electromagnetism
(QED, nonlinear optics, plasma physics), described by higher-order field corrections such as:
                                           1           α2
                                    L = − Fµν F µν + 4 (Fµν F µν )2 + . . . ,                                (3)
                                           4           me
yielding topologically nontrivial configurations or stable soliton-like solutions acting as informational worm-
holes.
4     Cross-Branch and Retrocausal Communication
Classical quantum mechanics forbids direct communication across decohered many-world branches. How-
ever, speculative non-linear quantum theories or advanced quantum error-correcting structures might allow
limited cross-branch interference or retrocausal signaling, if one introduces slight randomness (quantum
off-shell fluctuations). A small intrinsic probabilistic uncertainty (”faulty-switch” randomness) prevents
deterministic infinite loops, while quantum-holographic memory structures retain partial recollections of
overwritten timeline states.
    This theoretical scenario proposes cross-branch quantum communication by treating each decohered
branch as a quantum scar with partial synchronization, analogous to neural synchronization phenomena.
The presence of transient synchronization intervals (following Tsuda) implies effective channels of informa-
tion flow, describable mathematically as intervals with small synchronization distances ∥Xi (t)−Xj (t)∥ ≪ 1.
5     Cybernetic Wormhole Control and Stability
Maintaining stable, traversable informational wormholes requires active feedback control, leveraging Frad-
kov’s cybernetic synchronization principle. The adaptive ”speed-gradient” principle:
                                                       T
                                                  ∂Q(X)
                                     U (t) = −Γ            , Γ > 0,                                    (4)
                                                   ∂X
dynamically corrects deviations, stabilizing wormhole traversability and quantum coherence. The inter-
play between chaotic synchronization (Tsuda), adaptive cybernetic control (Fradkov), and solitonic attrac-
tor geometry (Ivancevic) yields a unified conceptual and mathematical construct termed the Cybernetic-
Wormhole-Attractor (CWA), defined formally as:
                                            CW Ai = (Σi , Ai , Ui ),                                        (5)
with traversability conditions given by intermittent high-synchronization measures.
6     Engineering Principles and Physical Realization
To physically realize a future internet embedding quantum informational wormholes and retrocausal com-
munication, consider engineering designs that:
    • Utilize dynamic Casimir-like quantum generation via rapidly evolving electromagnetic boundaries
      (neural-like structures or engineered plasma interfaces), extracting quantum fluctuations into real
      quanta.
    • Employ metamaterials and advanced plasma-based boundary layers, altering refractive indices for op-
      tical cloaking and acoustic silence (e.g., hypersonic craft), simultaneously managing optical, acoustic,
      and electromagnetic stealth through nonlinear plasma manipulation.
    • Incorporate adaptive cybernetic feedback loops, maintaining coherence and stability despite chaotic
      dynamics, environmental decoherence, and vacuum fluctuation randomness.
                                                       2
7      Theoretical and Mathematical Synthesis
Integrating all previously discussed concepts, define the new fundamental construct explicitly:
    Cybernetic Quantum Wormhole Attractor (CQWA): A triple (Σi , ψscar , U (t)), where Σi rep-
resents dynamically evolving boundary conditions, ψscar represents quantum scar states, and U (t) is the
cybernetic control input ensuring coherence and traversability.
    The total Hamiltonian, including dynamic boundary conditions and cybernetic feedback, is then ex-
pressed as:
                           HCW A (t) = HQF T + Hboundary [Σ(t)] + Hf eedback [U (t)],                (6)
providing a self-consistent framework unifying quantum fields, boundary conditions, and adaptive controls.
8      Physical Plausibility and Experimental Prospects
Actual implementation will require breakthroughs in quantum optics, high-energy nonlinear media, and
sophisticated quantum error-correcting protocols. Nevertheless, quantum optics, nonlinear metamateri-
als, photonics, and quantum-electrodynamical experiments may feasibly explore these regimes, providing
empirical tests for quantum scar stabilization, dynamical boundary-induced coherence, and transient cross-
branch synchronization.

We first correct the equation (7) for improved readability and LaTeX clarity:

                                        | i         {z          }            |       {z         }

    This explicitly illustrates the decomposition into Cybernetic Wormhole Attractors (CWA) and nonlinear
electromagnetic components.
10      Advanced Mathematical and Physical Extensions
10.1    Gauge Field Theory and Quantum Phase Shifts
Gauge invariance in quantum electrodynamics permits nonlocal vector potential effects (Aharonov–Bohm
effect), allowing quantum phase shifts without direct energy transfer. Formally, the gauge-invariant phase
shift for a charged particle around a closed path C is given by:
                                                     I
                                                   q
                                            ∆φ =        Aµ dxµ .                                       (8)
                                                   ℏ C
    These gauge fields, precisely manipulated by cybernetic feedback (as described by Fradkov’s adaptive
control), create informational wormhole structures capable of transferring quantum information with no
direct classical energy transport.

11     Extension to Quantum Chaotic Attractors and Lyapunov
       Exponents
Quantum chaos theory explores how classical chaos emerges from quantum mechanics via semiclassical
limits, particularly related to Lyapunov exponents. Consider a quantum system evolving via unitary
operators U (t); a quantum Lyapunov exponent λQ measures exponential sensitivity to initial conditions
via the commutator growth of two initially commuting operators W and V :
                                     C(t) = −⟨[W (t), V (0)]2 ⟩ ∼ e2λt ,                               (9)
    where positive λ indicates quantum chaos. By engineering quantum wormholes (as described) to act
as stable quantum chaotic attractors, Lyapunov exponents can be dynamically controlled or suppressed,
ensuring reliable information traversal.
12     Gauge Fields, Chaos Control, and Vector Potential Neuro-
       science
The nonlinear gauge fields described in Ivancevic’s field-theoretic formalism allow a chaotic scalar-gauge
field Lagrangian:
                                           1           1
                              L(ϕ, Aµ ) = − Fµν F µν + g µν ∂µ ϕ ∂ν ϕ − V (ϕ).                       (10)
                                           4           2
   Control of chaos, as outlined by Fradkov, implies feedback terms of the form:
                                                     δQ[ϕ, Aµ ]
                                           Uµ = −Γ              ,                                    (11)
                                                       δAµ
    acting directly on gauge fields. Coupled with neural tissue acting as dynamical boundary conditions,
we obtain closed-loop control systems stabilizing quantum chaos (as in Tsuda’s synchronization), directly
linking neural dynamics with gauge theories and chaos control.
13     High-Dimensional Hypercomputational and Cybernetic Ex-
       tension
A hypercomputational device exploiting quantum field nonlinearities and chaos synchronization—proposed
in prior notes as the ”Quantum Photonic Stone”—can be formally described by high-dimensional Hamil-
tonians integrating cybernetic principles:
                                Hhyper = HQED + Hchaos (ϕ, Aµ ) + Hcontrol ,                         (12)
    where chaotic synchronization across multiple quantum branches yields computational resources sur-
passing classical or even standard quantum computational limits. Formally, computational efficiency of
such a device could be measured against standard quantum complexity classes (BQP), conjecturally placing
it into exotic complexity classes associated with hypercomputation or super-Turing computation.

14     Neural Precognition via Quantum Vector Potential (A-wave)
       Fields
Finally, in line with the ”Tachyonic Neuroscience” concept, neurons interacting with quantum electromag-
netic vector potential fields could experience nontrivial quantum phase shifts without conventional energy
transfer, enabling informational signals from future states (advanced potentials):
                                                 Z                          
                                                 i t+∆t ′
                        ψneural (t + ∆t) = exp −          dt Ĥneuro-EM (Aµ ) ψneural (t),            (13)
                                                 ℏ t
   where Ĥneuro-EM (Aµ ) encodes neural sensitivity to quantum vector potentials. The neural state vector
at time t + ∆t acquires phase shifts from future Aµ configurations (A-waves), potentially facilitating a
quantum-informational explanation of dream precognition phenomena and neural foresight.
15     Cybernetic Schelling Calculus and Recursive Hyperstruc-
       tures
Employing Schelling calculus as defined earlier, we model the recursive interplay of future knowledge and
present actions using stable equilibria (Schelling points) in probabilistic temporal loops. Formally:
                                                   X
                                      S(X, t) = −      p(x, t) log p(x, t),                           (14)
                                                x∈X
   with iterative hyperstructures capturing future and past information exchanges as recursive Bayesian
updates on probability distributions, stabilizing temporal informational loops.
16     Consolidated Mathematical Framework
The entire extended framework of ”The Future Internet Collides With Now,” bringing together all concepts
discussed, may now be succinctly represented as an interconnected set of equations:
                       M
              FI(t) =     (HQuantum-Scar (t) ⊗ HCWA (t) ⊗ Hhypercomputing ) ⊗ Qneuro-EM (Aµ , t).   (15)
                      Nodes
   Here, FI(t) encapsulates the evolving future-internet hyperstructure, integrating quantum-scar worm-
hole attractors, cybernetic chaos control, quantum vector-potential neuroscience, hypercomputation, and
recursive Schelling-based temporal logic.
17     Further Theoretical Integration and Prospective Directions
The developed mathematical construct could underpin further theoretical and experimental explorations
into the physics of information, cross-temporal cybernetics, hypercomputational limits, and neuroscience-
based quantum informatics. Potential practical implementations may encompass quantum-photonic ex-
periments, EEG-neural-vector potential coupling studies, and simulations of chaotic neural-scar synchro-
nization dynamics to validate components of this theory empirically.
