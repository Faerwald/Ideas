                                                   Abstract
          Communication across multiple contexts—human-to-human, human-to-AI, or across temporal
      boundaries—introduces intrinsic errors due to translation, interpretation, and informational encoding
      and decoding. This paper outlines the analogy between iterative misinterpretation across these con-
      texts and cryptographic one-way functions, formalizing concepts using information theory, statistical
      inference, and physics principles. We emphasize error correction methodologies, transformer-based
      translation errors, and cross-modal information mapping.
1     Introduction
Communication between individuals separated by time, technological interfaces, or even consciousness
states can introduce significant informational distortions. These distortions, analogous to cryptographic
one-way functions, render the original meaning nearly irretrievable or heavily obfuscated without additional
context or keys. Such distortion is especially apparent in interpreting abstract notes from potential future
consciousness, as errors accumulate and compound iteratively.
2     Classification of Errors
We identify the following error categories relevant to this framework:
    • Misinterpretation Errors: Incorrectly assigning meaning to information due to ambiguity or
      cognitive biases.
    • Transformer-based Translation Errors: Semantic distortions introduced by deep learning mod-
      els translating between languages.
    • One-way Functional Errors: Asymmetric translation, akin to one-way cryptographic functions,
      causing irreversible ambiguity in meaning.
    • Cross-modal Errors: Information losses occurring when converting data from one modality (e.g.,
      image, text, EEG) to another.
3     Mathematical Formalism
Information theory provides the ideal formalism. Considering Shannon’s entropy:
                                                 X
                                       H(X) = −     p(x) log2 p(x)                                            (1)
                                                     x∈X
                                                       1
                                Information and Temporal Misinterpretation
where distortion corresponds to entropy increases, reducing mutual information I(X; Y ) between source
(X) and receiver (Y ), calculated as:
                                        I(X; Y ) = H(X) − H(X|Y )                                       (2)
Misinterpretation corresponds mathematically to high conditional entropy H(X|Y ).
4    Transformer-based Translation Errors
Transformer models approximate conditional probability distributions of translations. Errors manifest
through loss functions optimized via cross-entropy:
                                                              X
                                   Lcross-entropy (ŷ, y) = −   yi log(ŷi )                      (3)
                                                             i
where ŷ is the predicted translation distribution, and y the true distribution.
5    Error Correction
To mitigate information loss, error-correcting codes (ECC), specifically low-density parity-check (LDPC)
codes, are applied:
                             HcT = 0, where H is the parity-check matrix                              (4)
Implementing ECC (error-correcting codes) analogous to temporal and cognitive contexts can substantially
reduce noise and enhance fidelity.
6    One-Way Functions and Temporal Cryptography
Time-directional communication is analogous to cryptographic one-way functions:
                   y = f (x),   such that finding x given y is computationally infeasible               (5)
This provides an intuitive parallel: future selves possess computational resources or keys unavailable to
past selves, making information easily verified but not originated in past contexts.
7    Discussion
Just as transformers improve language translation, iterative contextual interactions and self-feedback loops
(recursive communications) gradually correct informational distortions. However, fundamental information-
theoretic barriers limit reconstruction accuracy, suggesting that absolute accuracy remains asymptotic.
8    Conclusion
The informational complexity of communication across time and modality demands robust error correction
informed by mathematical rigor. Employing information theory and cryptographic analogies clarifies the
nature of distortion and facilitates strategies to mitigate or even leverage it.
