1    Raychaudhuri and congruence focusing
For a timelike geodesic congruence with 4–velocity ua (aa ≡ ub ∇b ua = 0), define expansion θ = ∇a ua ,
shear σab = ∇(a ub) − 13 θhab − ωab , vorticity ωab = ∇[a ub] , hab = gab + ua ub . The Raychaudhuri equation is
                                 dθ    1
                                    = − θ2 − σab σ ab + ωab ω ab − Rab ua ub .                              (1)
                                 dτ    3
For irrotational flows (ωab = 0) and matter obeying the strong energy condition (Rab ua ub ≥ 0), initially
converging congruences focus (θ → −∞) in finite proper time. For null congruences with tangent k a ,
                                      dθ    1

central to lensing, area theorems, and GW memory (Sec. 11).
2    Geodesic deviation, geodetic precession, and “thrust”
Relative acceleration of neighboring geodesics with separation η a :
                                          D2 η α
                                                 = −Rα βγδ uβ η γ uδ .                                      (3)
                                          dτ 2
This is the tidal strain measured by interferometers. A spinless gyroscope undergoing parallel transport
along a geodesic in curved spacetime exhibits geodetic (de Sitter) precession:
                                        3 v×g
                                ΩdS =              (weak-field, slow-motion).                               (4)
                                        2 c2
Remark. In asymptotically flat GR, closed cyclic variations of internal configuration cannot yield net
center-of-mass acceleration without exchanging momentum with fields or distant matter: any apparent
“geodesic thrust” must be balanced by radiation or ambient momentum flux.
3    Aharonov–Bohm, Aharonov–Casher, and HMW phases
Topological EM phases are control knobs for matter-wave metrology:

                                     ϕAC = 2 (E × µ) · dx,                                                  (6)

4    Matter-wave gravity: the COW phase
For a neutron (mass m) interferometer enclosing area A with arm-averaged vertical separation in uni-
form g, the Colella–Overhauser–Werner phase is
                                                        mgA
                                           ∆ϕCOW =          ,                                        (8)
                                                         ℏv
with beam speed v. Rotation induces an independent Sagnac phase enabling separation of g and Ω
contributions by symmetry flips.
5    Spin-rotation (Mashhoon) coupling
Intrinsic spin couples to rotation/gravitomagnetism. For an observer rotating with angular velocity Ω,
a two-level spin system sees an energy shift
                                            ∆E = −Ω · S ,                                            (9)
and, for light/matter waves, an associated phase proportional to helicity or spin projection. This is the
local, quantum counterpart of frame-dragging effects.
6    Sagnac and gravitomagnetic clock effects
For counter-propagating beams enclosing vector area A, the kinematic Sagnac time lag for light is
∆t = 4 Ω · A/c2 . In GR, stationary axisymmetric metrics add a gravitomagnetic (Lense–Thirring)
contribution. For a ring laser of perimeter P and wavelength λ,
                                                    4Ω · A
                                             ∆f =          ,                                        (10)
                                                     λP
with additional ppm-level terms from Earth’s geodetic and frame-dragging fields targeted by ultra-stable
arrays.
7    Frame dragging (Lense–Thirring)
A spinning mass with angular momentum J drags local inertial frames. In the weak-field, far-zone
limit,
                                                G
                                      ΩLT = 2 3 [3(J · r̂) r̂ − J] ,                        (11)
                                              cr
producing nodal precessions in satellite orbits and gyroscope drifts.
8    Gravitational Magnus effect (spin–curvature lift)
For an extended spinning body, the Mathisson–Papapetrou–Dixon (MPD) equations govern motion:
                                         Dpa      1
                                              = − Ra bcd ub S cd ,                                  (12)
                                         dτ       2
                                        DS ab
                                              = pa ub − pb ua ,                                     (13)
                                         dτ
supplemented by S ab pb = 0 (Tulczyjew–Dixon) or S ab ub = 0 (Pirani). In backgrounds with mass–energy
currents (gravitomagnetism or matter flow), the spin–curvature force admits a component orthogonal
to the velocity and spin, a true GR analog of Magnus lift. Observable consequences include secular
orbital-plane drifts in accretion flows and dark-matter halos.

9    Extended-body motion and Harte’s effective field
For self-gravitating bodies, Harte’s framework defines physical momenta by integrating the stress–
energy over hypersurfaces with appropriate Killing transport, yielding motion in an effective metric

              ab where hab is the Detweiler–Whiting regular field. To leading order,
                                Dpa    1
                                    = − Ra bcd ub S cd + O(multipoles),                             (14)

i.e. motion is geodesic in gab   with renormalized multipole moments; the MiSaTaQuWa self-force is
recovered in the small-body limit via

10     Radiation reaction and dynamical friction
GW reaction. At 2.5PN order, energy–angular momentum loss is governed by the quadrupole formula
                                                 G ... ...
                                          P =       Q ij Q ij ,                                     (16)
                                                5c5
driving inspiral; in extreme mass ratio, the self-force description above applies.
Dynamical friction. A massive body of mass M moving with speed v through a collisionless back-
ground of density ρ and dispersion σ experiences (Chandrasekhar)

11     Gravitational waves: memory and symmetry triangle
Displacement memory. A burst of radiation leaves a DC offset in the transverse-traceless strain,

                                    Z

                        ∆hij =           du Fij (u) (schematic),                              (18)
                                  r −∞
where Fij includes linear (source) and nonlinear (Christodoulou) fluxes. Test masses undergo a perma-

Spin memory. Angular-momentum flux produces a relative time delay for counter-propagating null
rays along a loop C,                            I
                                       ∆Tspin ∼ dℓA ϵAB ∆ΞB ,                                     (19)

with Ξ a (Bondi) shear-related potential. Both memories are facets of the infrared triangle: asymptotic
symmetries (BMS), soft theorems, and memory observables.
12     Propagation in curved backgrounds: Faraday and spin Hall
Gravitational Faraday (Skrotskii) rotation. In stationary weak fields, light polarization         rotates
                                                                                      1
                                                                                        R
by an angle set by the line integral of the gravitomagnetic field; schematically ∆χ ∝ 2 (∇ × Ag ) · dℓ/c,
where Ag is the g0i potential.
Spin Hall of light/GWs. Beyond geometric optics, Berry curvature of helicity-s waves produces
transverse shifts δx⊥ ∝ s λ ∇×(· · · ), yielding polarization-dependent lensing/time delays near rotating
lenses.
                                                      3
13     Gravitational Aharonov–Bohm
Global geometry can imprint phases even where local curvature vanishes. Around a straight cosmic
string with deficit angle ∆ = 8πGµ, the conical metric yields AB-like interference and characteristic
scattering despite Rab = 0 off the core. This is the pure-gravity topological analog of AB.
14     Quantum-clock interferometry
Let an internal clock of frequency ω0 be delocalized along two paths with proper times τ1 , τ2 . The
doubly-differential protocol isolates gravitational redshift:
                                         ∆ϕclock = ω0 (τ1 − τ2 ),                                   (20)
with path engineering (e.g. guided fountains) suppressing acceleration noise and common-mode phases
(Sagnac/laser).
15     Optical “lift” as an analog control
In structured light, circular electric dipoles experience transverse forces (spin–orbit and Belinfante
momentum contributions), a photonic analog of Magnus lift. Calibrated optical traps thus provide
tabletop surrogates for gravitomagnetic lift parameter inference and signal-processing pipelines.
16     Relativistic driver fields and apparent “antigravity”
In linearized GR, a fast mass produces gravitoelectric Eg and gravitomagnetic Bg fields. For ultra-
relativistic transit, Eg is strongly forward-collimated and v × Bg terms can yield coordinate acceler-
ations that are locally repulsive along the axis for test particles in certain frames. This “hyperdrive”
phenomenology is a time-dependent-field, geodesic effect—not negative mass. Physical 4-acceleration
remains consistent with energy conditions; momentum exchange occurs with the gravitational field (and
radiation).
17     Energy conditions and warp metrics
Alcubierre-type warp geometries with superluminal effective bubble speed require violations of the
averaged null energy condition. Variants that reduce energy budgets engineer subluminal, compact
support, or tailored lapse/shift profiles, but still demand exotic stress–energy. Any laboratory approach
must target effective index analogs rather than genuine superluminal transport.
18     Minimal experiment design patterns
Phase-basis interferometer. Co-design a loop that supports AB/AC/HMW, COW, and Sagnac
contributions. By flipping E/B, swapping arm heights, and reversing rotation, solve the linear system
of phases to isolate gravitational, topological, and kinematic pieces with ppm accuracy.
Spin-lift metrology. Use optically trapped, spinning microspheres to calibrate Magnus-type trans-
verse responses, porting estimators to MPD templates for astrophysical environments.
Chronometric baselines. Implement quantum-clock interferometry on tall guided paths to differen-
tially read out redshift at the single-clock level.
