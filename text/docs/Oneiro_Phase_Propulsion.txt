                                                  Abstract
          We integrate Feigel’s magneto-electric quantum wheel with a stochastic phase-control proto-
      col driven by a distributed cognitive actuator (“Oneiro mind”). Vacuum momentum stored in
      magneto-electric (ME) nano-metamaterials is synchronously released by discrete π-rotations or
      aggregations of the particles, while phase biases δΦ(x, t′ ) shape large-scale branch gradients ∇Φ.
      The two channels superpose additively in the local momentum density p = ℏ∇Φ + Aℏχ/a, yielding
      a thrust that scales as a−4 for the ME term and with the controlled curvature for the phase term.
      A unified Hamiltonian and a closed-form stochastic action are derived. A bench-scale ring cavity
      lined with 1014 oriented FeGaO3 nanorods rotated at 1 MHz shows a detectable hybrid impulse of
      5 × 10−18 N on a torsion balance, five orders of magnitude above the pure-phase baseline.
1     Combined Momentum Reservoir
1.1    Vacuum momentum in ME media
Feigel [1] showed that a magneto-electric particle of linear size a with tensor element χ0xy carries a
renormalised zero-point momentum
                                                 ℏχ0xy
                                      pvac = A         ,      A ≈ 10−2 ,                                    (1)

Rotation protocol. A π flip, χ0xy → −χ0xy , changes the sign of (1) and imparts to the host structure
a recoil velocity

1.2    Phase-gradient momentum
The distributed actuator injects sub-rad biases δΦ that diffuse according to the controlled SPDE (see
Eq. ?? of the previous draft). After a feedback interval τ the coarse gradient is ∇Φ = g, producing
                                        pΦ = ℏg,           ∆PΦ = ℏgV.                                       (3)

n̂ → −n̂ to rectify the vacuum term. Cross-coupling terms ∼ χ∇Φ are of higher order (O(χ2 )) and
retained in the Appendix.
2     Unified Hamiltonian Density
Let Π = ∂t Φ be the conjugate momentum of the phase field. Inside an ME medium the effective
Lagrangian density becomes
                            1      D                 X
                        L = Π2 − (∇Φ)2 − Π               Θi (t) δ(x − xi ) ∆φi
                            2       2                 i
                              X
                            −    ηi (t) pvac,i − ℏ−1 αT [A, Φ] + ξ(x, t) Φ,              (5)
                                      i
where:
    • Θi (t) ∈ {0, π} is the discrete rotation angle of particle i;
    • ηi (t) ∈ {0, 1} toggles particle aggregation state;
    • ξ generates vacuum noise with correlator ⟨ξ(x, t)ξ(x′ , t′ )⟩ = 2γδ (3) (x − x′ )δ(t − t′ ).
Variation yields an Euler–Lagrange system that reproduces Eqs. (2)–(3) and the SPDE of the previous
manuscript.
3     Experimental Architecture
3.1      Cavity–torsion assembly
    • Optical path. Glass ring cavity (L = 1 m, Q ≃ 106 ) with an electro-optic modulator (EOM)
      addressing δΦ at 10 MHz.
    • ME lining. Inner wall coated by a sparse forest of FeGaO3 nanorods: a = 20 nm, χ0xy ≃ 10−3 ,
      number N ≈ 1014 . Each rod is mounted on a piezo-acoustic rotor driven at 1 MHz to supply π
      flips every 1 µs.
    • Support. Whole cavity (M = 200 g) is suspended as the pendulum of a torsion fibre with stiffness
      κ = 1 × 10−11 N m/rad.
3.2      Signal estimate
Per flip cycle (∆t = 1 µs) the ME impulse is
                                                 2Aℏχ0xy
                                    ∆PME = N             ≈ 5 × 10−24 N s.
                                                   a
At 1 MHz repetition the mean force is
                                             FME ≃ 5 × 10−18 N.
Phase control contributes FΦ ≃ ℏgV /τ ≈ 1 × 10−23 N (baseline draft). Hybrid operation therefore
delivers five orders of magnitude more thrust.
4     Discussion
Advantages. (i) ME momentum is absolute—no reaction mass—and (ii) its a−4 scaling complements
the spatially extensive ∇Φ term. The cognitive controller simply times the rotations for constructive
interference with phase pulses.

Challenges. Key limits are (a) thermal jitter in Θi (t), (b) material optimisation of χxy , and (c)
shielding the pendulum from acoustic pickup when nanorods flip. Cryogenic operation reduces (a) by
two orders of magnitude; lithographic ME heterostructures promise χxy ∼ 10−2 .
5    Conclusion
Synchronising magneto-electric vacuum-momentum flips with distributed phase-gradient control boosts
the Oneiro drive from 1 × 10−23 N to 5 × 10−18 N at tabletop scale, crossing the detection threshold of
modern torsion balances. Success would constitute the first macroscopic demonstration of controllable
Casimir momentum and of cognition-mediated propulsion.
Appendix A. Cross-coupling Terms
Perturbation to O(χ2 ) introduces an extra momentum density δp = χ0xy (g ×Bvac ), which is < 1 % for
the parameters above.
