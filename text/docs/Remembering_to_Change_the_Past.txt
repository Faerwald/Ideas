Remembering to Change the Past
                                         A Rigorous Perspective
                                               March 6, 2025
                                                    Abstract
         This article revisits and rewrites an earlier science-oriented paper on the interplay between memory,
     imagination, subjective time loops, and the idea of “changing the past.” Here, we address these
     concepts in a scientifically grounded way. While people often refer to changing the past as “illusory,”
     there is a compelling sense in which it is actually real, manifested through reconstructive memory,
     incomplete records, and interpretive frameworks that can retroactively reshape our personal histories
     and knowledge. We draw on modern neuroscience, mathematics, computational modeling, physics,
     and engineering to show that although physically re-writing old events in the objective world remains
     outside standard physics, the subjective—and in some respects practical —reality of changing
     the past is supported by robust evidence from psychology, Bayesian inference, partial observation,
     and the re-interpretation of old notes or personal records. The goal is to acknowledge the genuine
     phenomenon of retroactive revision and illustrate how these processes are consistent with contemporary
     science.

1     Introduction
Many individuals, upon re-reading notes from a previous decade or revisiting old personal records, find
newly discovered resonances with more recent events. They may even realize that their past writings seem
to anticipate knowledge they only consciously acquired years later. In such moments, one might say: “I
am truly changing my past, because I am reinterpreting what those older lines meant, or discovering that
I was on the brink of a future idea even then.”
    While some call this experience an illusion, we here adopt the stance that, from a psychological and
informational viewpoint, such revision is genuinely real. We make a distinction between:
    • Physical retrocausality in a literal, material sense: Overturning cause-and-effect in external
      reality (strictly unsupported by mainstream physics).
    • Subjective or informational retrocausality: The observer updates older knowledge states or
      personal recollections in light of new information, forging a coherent but restructured narrative of
      “what happened”—in effect changing the past in their internal landscape (yet with real personal and
      social impact).
   Thus, the REALITY of changing the past refers to that second dimension: the reorganization of
memory, knowledge, and meaning around older evidence, notes, or personal data in ways that truly shift
how one interprets past events.
2     Revisiting Core Phenomena
2.1    Neuroscience & Reconstructive Memory
Neurological and psychological research establishes that memory is not a verbatim record but a reconstruc-
tive process [1, 2]. Each time we recall or reflect on past events, we rebuild the memory, often embedding
new context or interpretations. This plasticity is central to the phenomenon of “changing the past.” Old
notebooks serve as partial constraints on what we wrote, but the intent, emotional tone, and interpretation
can all be newly synthesized [3].
2.2    Examples of Real-World “Past Revisions”
    • Personal Diaries: Someone stumbles on a journal from ten years prior, reading lines that resonate
      with knowledge they only recently acquired. They re-interpret those lines as “foreshadowing,” at-
      tributing deeper meaning to them than was originally intended. This changes their sense of who
      they were back then.
                                                      2
    • Technical Notes or Research Logs: Scientists sometimes find that an old lab notebook contained
      the seeds of an idea they only formalized years later. They then recast the older data as evidence of
      earlier insight, effectively rewriting the significance of those old logs.
3     Information Theory and Bayesian Models
3.1    Partial Observation and Retroactive Updates
From a Bayesian standpoint, we only partially observe all relevant details from our past. Whenever new
evidence or interpretive frameworks appear (perhaps via a major life event or advanced knowledge), we
update our beliefs about what our old motivations, ideas, or interpretations might have been [4]. If the
evidence is ambiguous, multiple solutions remain plausible until a new inference pins down a certain
interpretation. Hence, we see subjective retrocausality: the person truly alters how they see the old event,
functionally changing the past in their mental model.
3.2    Constraint Satisfaction in Reinterpreted Records
Even with physical proof—like lines in a notebook—the meaning or impetus behind those lines is often
unconstrained. When the present self gains fresh perspective, it can reassign cause or significance to old
text. In constraint satisfaction language, one forms a new assignment for the “latent variables” representing
the older mind’s reasoning. This new solution is consistent with the raw data (the text) but changes the
story of the past.
4     Contemporary Physics and “Real” Retrocausation
4.1    No Established Physical Mechanism to Rewrite Past Matter
Leading physics does not endorse a known mechanism for literally reconfiguring ink on old pages or states
of matter in the past [5, 6]. While certain solutions to general relativity or exotic quantum interpretations
(for instance, transactionalist or retrocausal views [7]) gesture at the idea, no experiment has shown
macroscopic rewriting of established records.
4.2    Quantum Inspiration
Quantum phenomena such as the “delayed-choice quantum eraser” [8] can appear to let future measure-
ments define past realities. But these are typically interpretive illusions. The standard mathematical
formalism retains forward-in-time unitarity, and no global violation of causality is confirmed. Nonetheless,
these phenomena can inspire analogies in subjective or informational contexts.
5     Practical Realizations in Computation
5.1    Version Control: Retroactive Meaning in Code
Modern software engineering with tools like Git indeed allows a developer to revisit older commits, rein-
terpret them, or annotate them with new knowledge. If we treat the code comments or commit messages
as partial evidence, the developer’s newly assigned meaning to that old branch changes the story of how
a feature was conceived. Although physically the older commit remains the same, the interpretation can
drastically shift. This is functionally similar to rewriting the code’s past.
                                                     3
5.2    Machine Learning: Continual and Generative Memory
Continual learning in neural networks [9] can introduce new training data that calls for reparametrizing
or replaying prior examples. Some approaches maintain generative models of old data, which the network
reimagines in light of new tasks [10]. In effect, the internal representation of older data is updated,
changing the network’s sense of what was previously “true.” Functionally, the network’s “past states” are
re-encoded.
6     The REALITY of Changing the Past
6.1    Distinction Between Physical and Informational Causality
While physically re-inscribing older documents before they were written remains unsupported by contem-
porary science, altering the meaning or role of those documents in the present is not only feasible but
demonstrably practiced. Hence, there is a real sense in which people, companies, or even large neural net-
works change the past to the extent that past events were never fully pinned down, enabling new inferences
that redefine them.
6.2    Scientific Validation of the Phenomenon
Empirical studies of autobiographical memory, false memories, and constructive reprocessing confirm that
individuals can hold old records yet reinterpret them as signifying something quite different from the
original context. This rewriting can literally alter someone’s daily behavior or future decisions, underscoring
the practical—and arguably real —consequences of changing the past on the subjective plane.
7     Conclusion
Renaming this phenomenon “the reality of changing the past” underscores the point that, from an internal,
cognitive, or informational perspective, such retroactive revisions are more than illusions: they yield actual
consequences. Old notes genuinely can appear to foreshadow or contain knowledge from later events,
and personal diaries can transform in meaning over time, creating new narratives and identities. The
interpretive frameworks of neuroscience, Bayesian inference, and partial data constraints each show how
this re-interpretation is not only possible but routinely experienced. Far from dismissing it as a mere
illusion, contemporary scientific paradigms explain why it happens and how it can be so persuasive, even
while standard physics maintains that the external world’s past remains causally invariant.
8     Extended Reflections: Quantum Boundary Conditions & Sub-
      jective Retrocausality
Although the standard physical view disallows macroscopic rewriting of recorded events, recent theoreti-
cal explorations in quantum neuroscience and quantum cognition have entertained analogies where neural
structures act like time-dependent boundary conditions for quantum fields. Such models propose that dy-
namically evolving neural boundaries could, in principle, stabilize certain quantum states—sometimes
called “quantum scars” in analogy to stable eigenstates in chaotic quantum systems. While not literally
changing the past in a classical sense, these frameworks highlight how perceptions of time, memory, and
internal narratives could be deeply tied to boundary dynamics in a quantum substrate [11, 12].
                                                      4
8.1     Subjective Retrocausality and Neural Scarring
In the same way that a quantum scar retains a “memory” of classical periodic orbits in an otherwise chaotic
domain, the human brain might encode stable patterns of recollection or meaning that persist even as new
experiences rewrite interpretive frameworks. Thus, when an individual revisits an old diary entry:
    1. Their neural structures and synaptic weights have evolved,
    2. But they still maintain resonances (scar-like patterns) that preserve partial constraints of earlier
       states,
    3. The result is a simultaneous continuity and transformation of meaning in a neural or cognitive
       architecture.
This parallels the phenomenon of “revisiting the past” cognitively while re-imposing new boundary conditions—
leading to altered interpretations in the present.
8.2     Dynamical Casimir Analogies for Reconstructive Memory
The dynamical Casimir effect predicts that changing the boundary conditions of a quantum field can
produce real particles from vacuum fluctuations [13]. By analogy, each time we “revisit” an old memory, we
are effectively imposing a new boundary on the partially unobserved “vacuum” of prior mental states. New
interpretations or subjective particles (i.e., new bits of meaning or narrative) emerge, giving the impression
of retroactive shifts. This is not to claim literal photon creation in the brain but rather to underscore how
rapid boundary evolutions (e.g., changes in neural connectivity or perspective) can generate tangible new
content in one’s mental model of the past.
9     Future Directions: Bridging Quantum and Informational Retro-
      causality
9.1     Experimental Possibilities
While we cannot experimentally alter macroscopically recorded history, researchers could explore:
    • Neurobiological measures: Identifying correlated neural activity patterns that shift upon revisit-
      ing old diaries or notebooks, revealing real-time rewiring of past associations.
    • Controlled memory reconsolidation experiments: Tracking subtle changes in participants’
      recall of older events after they learn new but contextually relevant information.
    • Quantum-inspired cognitive models: Developing mathematical models that use time-dependent
      boundary conditions as a metaphor for how new experiences can reorganize memory representations
      in the brain.
9.2     Engineering and Software Analogies
Beyond neuroscience, these principles resonate with:
    • Version-control analytics: Studying how developers or designers “reinterpret” older commits or
      documentation in collaborative projects, effectively rewriting the meaning of why certain decisions
      were made.
    • AI systems with generative replay: Investigating how machine learning models re-encode and
      re-interpret old data in light of newly trained tasks, forging a parallel to subjective retrocausality in
      human cognition.

10     Final Remarks on “Changing the Past”
The tension between immutable physical history and mutable subjective interpretation under-
scores the subtlety of “changing the past.” Despite our current physical laws forbidding literal rewriting of
prior material states, the active reinterpretation of partially observed or ambiguous records is a powerful,
real phenomenon. Drawing on neuroscience, Bayesian inference, and even quantum boundary condition
analogies, we see that much of the “past” was never fully determined to begin with. It lay in an uncer-
tain superposition of possible explanations or motives, awaiting future insights to crystallize it into a new
interpretive form.
    In this sense, each present moment reshapes the “record” we hold in mind; we do not topple the
arrow of time, but we do re-sculpt its trajectory in our personal narratives. Whether this re-sculpting is
cast in classical memory terms or via speculative quantum boundary analogies, the phenomenon remains
fundamentally real—and thoroughly human.
