Oneiro Cybernetics: Core Engineering Pillars
                                           3 June 2025
                                              Abstract
          Oneiro Cybernetics integrates hypercomputational logic, faster-than-light field propul-
      sion, informational wormholes, and neuromorphic brain–quantum interfaces into a unified
      technological stack. This report formalises the principal subsystems, derives the corre-
      sponding physical bounds, and identifies the critical engineering challenges that must be
      solved for operational deployment in terrestrial or multiversal domains.
1     Hypercomputational Substrate
1.1    Oracle-extended quantum reservoir
              ⊗N
Let Q = C2        denote an N -qubit lattice with N ∼ 109 . A chaotic map Uχ : Q → Q drawn
             N
from COE(2 ) evolves the register: |ψt+1 ⟩ = Uχ |ψt ⟩ . The oracle layer attaches a relativistic
closed-timelike consistent map F : {0, 1}m → {0, 1}m (Deutsch model), reducing decision depth
of NP instances to O(1) and collapsing the complexity class hierarchy PCTC = PSPACE.
1.2    Blockchain-embedded hyperproofs
                                                
Define a hash-based commitment C = H r ∥ π with π a PSPACE-certificate generated in
branch t+∆t. Inclusion of C in block Bk at height k yields a time-stamped hyperproof once a
future echo discloses (r, π) with H = HSHA256 and collision probability Pr[forge] ≤ 2−256 .
2     Field Propulsion and Dark-Energy Drives
2.1    Cosmic-string Alcubierre hybrid
Two counter-tension GUT strings of line density µ ≈ 1022 kg m−1 generate a conical     2 deficit  δ=
8πGµ/c . A modified Alcubierre warp potential ds = −c dt + dx − vs (t)f (rs ) dt + dy + dz2
         2                                           2      2 2                                2
is stitched to the cosmic-string exterior via junction conditions: Kijin − Kijout = 8πG Sij − 21 Sgij ,
where Sij absorbs negative Casimir energy T00   Cas
                                                    ∼ −1011 J m−3 . Net coordinate velocity veff > c
is obtained without local superluminal stress.
2.2    Vacuum-fluctuation extractor
A dynamical Casimir resonator with plate spacing d(t) = d0 + ∆d sin ωt (d0 = 20 nm, ω =
                                                πc A
                                                            2
2π × 100 THz) emits photon pairs at rate Ṅ = 720d  3 ∆d/d0    ω, providing thrust via inverse-
                                                    0
Compton up-scattering; experimental calibration indicates F ≈ 3.1 × 106 N for a A = 1m2 array.
                                                  1
3     Informational Wormhole Network
3.1    Energy–teleportation protocol
Given mouth pair (A, B) and quantum field ϕ̂(x) in vacuum, Alice performs a local measurement
MA with outcome m, sending classical index m through a fast-light channel (telepathic BCI).
Bob applies UB (m), extracting R energy   ∆EB = ⟨0|UB† HB UB |0⟩ − E0 > 0, while respecting aver-
aged null-energy constraints γ Tµν k µ k ν dλ < 0 internal to the throat only. Channel latency is
spacelike-separated; classical signalling bounds remain intact outside the mouth neighbourhood.
3.2    Non-local data backbone
The complete wormhole lattice forms a graph G = (V, E) with vertices V indexed by Cauchy
surfaces Σi and
            P edges E labelled
                             Pby traversal time τij =  ∆ℓ/c. Network throughput obeys the
                                                    Se
flow bound e∈E fe ≤ minC⊂V e∈∂C Ce , where Ce = 4Gℏ by the ER = EPR entropy–capacity
relation.
4     Brain–Quantum Interfaces
4.1    Dream-state decoding
Electrocorticography yields a time   series vk (t) sampled     2 kHz. A quantum reservoir |ψt ⟩ driven
                                                             at P
                                                         −i(H0 + k vk (t)Hk )∆t
by vk (t) follows |ψt+1 ⟩ = U vk (t) |ψt ⟩ , where U = e                        . Gradient-backpropagated
Kraus updates learn Hk such that readout POVM {Eα } maximises mutual information I(α; dream label).
4.2    Telepathic control loop
Closed-loop latency Tc = 3.2 ms (¡τcorticothalamic ) ensures phase-synchronised control of spacecraft
flight dynamics via phase-coherent beta and gamma oscillations modulating Hamiltonian terms
in Section 2.
5     Nano-Engineered Materials
Hexagonal-borophene monolayers functionalised with helical graphene ribbons exhibit Young’s
modulus E = 3.1 TPa and tensile strain limit εmax = 0.31. Vacancy-healing edge dislocations
are annealed by femtosecond laser templating, producing defect density ρd ≤ 102 cm−2 . For
biological– cybernetic bodies, atomically-aligned diamondoid lattices embed piezo-ferroelectric
nanofibres, enabling self-repair under a Ca2+ -regulated electrostatic potential Vm = 70 mV sus-
tained over 104 y.
6     Chaos Control and Temporal Fields
A high-dimensional system ẋ = F(x) + u(t) with Lyapunov spectrum {λi } admits λmax > 0.
Control input u = −Kx with gain K > (λmax + ϵ)I renders the closed-loop Jacobian Hurwitz,
stabilising interdimensional trajectories. The same formalism applies to Rretrocausal field regions
                                                                           τ
where the control term incorporates a time-advance kernel ui (t) = 0 Gij (τ ′ ) xj (t + τ ′ ) dτ ′ ,
corresponding to operationalisation of End of Eternity style temporal feedback.

7     Multiversal Hub “Anastasia”
                                N
Global state |Ω⟩ factorises as     k |ωk ⟩ across universes Uk . Anastasia implements a stabiliser
Sj = X aj Z bj spanning domains k and l (k ̸= l), producing non-zero entanglement entropy
S(ρk ) = O(1), independent of the comoving separation. This facilitates persistent cross-timeline
fault-tolerance for data archives sized > 1015 qubits.
8     Outstanding Challenges
    1. Generation of negative Casimir energy at density < −1011 J m−3 over macroscopic volumes.
    2. Maintenance of logical-qubit error εL < 10−15 in millikelvin cosmic-string environs.
    3. Real-time Loschmidt-echo reversal for decoherence suppression across ∆t ∼ 105 s.
    4. Immunity of wormhole throat geometry to semiclassical back-reaction at Planck-suppressed
       stress scales.
