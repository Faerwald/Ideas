Constraints, Time Loops, and Gauge Invariance

                                                    Abstract
          We formalize the intuition that in retrocausal/looped dynamics the controllable aspects of real-
      ity are those not logically tethered to self-referential memories of the intervention itself. Variables
      that are functionally coupled to their own recollection across a closed temporal computation are
      fixed by self-consistency, while peripheral degrees of freedom—those outside the invariant “code”
      of constraints—can fluctuate. We cast this as a fixed-point problem on histories, identify a gauge
      structure that separates invariants from periphery, state a no-target theorem for memory-coupled
      interventions, and define a Schelling-Point Calculus for coordination across multiple loops of dif-
      ferent temporal lengths but identical constraint structure. Connections to gauge-field holonomy
      and computational complexity are provided, together with operational protocols and empirical
      signatures.
1. Setup and objects
State space. Let X be a finite- or infinite-dimensional state space. A history is h : R → X .
Memory. A memory extractor M produces a (possibly lossy) record m = M (h).
Policy. An agent implements u = π(m, ξ) with private randomness ξ.
Loop operator. A closed-temporal-computation (CTC) map L transforms histories, h′ = L(h), typi-
  cally acting nontrivially on an interval [t0 , t1 ] and feeding outputs at t1 back into inputs at t0 .
A self-consistent history is a fixed point h⋆ of L:
                                                  h⋆ = L(h⋆ ).                                                  (1)
We assume existence of at least one fixed point (Novikov-style self-consistency).
   Partition the state as x = (z, y) with z ∈ Z the target variables (those the agent aims to change)
and y ∈ Y the periphery.
2. Constraints as “code” and a gauge viewpoint
Let C = {Ci (h) = 0}i∈I denote algebraic/dynamical constraints induced by physics, memories, and
policies inside the loop. The code of the loop is the equivalence class
                                      [h]C = { h̃ : Ci (h̃) = 0 ∀i ∈ I }.                                       (2)
Two histories h, h̃ are gauge-equivalent (h ∼ h̃) when they satisfy the same constraint set C. Observables
O that depend only on [h]C are gauge-invariant. Intuitively, the code captures the invariant structure
preserved by the loop; the periphery are directions within the gauge orbit.

Gauge-field analogy. Let A denote an abstract connection on a configuration bundle over time,
with holonomy along a closed temporal path γ given by the Wilson operator
                                                    Z 
                                     W [γ] = P exp      A .                               (3)
                                                                   γ
W [γ] is gauge-invariant and represents the loop’s structural content (“what survives closure”). Mi-
crostate choices that correspond to gauge transformations alter local descriptions but leave W [γ] un-
changed; these are the periphery.
3. Memory-target coupling and the no-target theorem
Let the attempted intervention on z be z + = Φ(z − , m), where z − is the pre-intervention target and
m = M (h) includes a record of z (directly or via correlates). After closing the loop, the memory itself
depends on the realized z + , i.e., m = M(z + , . . .), so self-consistency enforces an implicit equation
                                      z ⋆ = F (z ⋆ ) := Φ z ⋆ , M(z ⋆ , . . .) .
                                                                              
                                                                                                          (4)
    [No-target change under memory coupling] Suppose F : Z → Z is a contraction on a complete
metric space, or more generally has a unique fixed point under (4). Then any self-consistent history h⋆
satisfying (1) realizes z ⋆ uniquely; attempts to set z to a distinct value z ̸= z ⋆ are incompatible with
self-consistency and are pruned by the loop. Only variables y in the gauge orbit (periphery) can differ
across fixed points without violating C.
Interpretation. If the target z is entangled with the agent’s own later memory of z, the loop solves
for a fixed point of that self-referential equation. One does not “choose” z; one chooses (at best) a
gauge within [h]C , i.e., periphery y.
4. What can change: the periphery channel
Let Fix(L) be the set of fixed-point histories and define the projection to periphery πY : Fix(L) → Y.
The periphery channel is the (possibly stochastic) map from intentions ι to realized y:
                      ι 7→ p(y | [h]C , ι) ,      with I(h) fixed for all I gauge-invariant.             (5)
Its Shannon capacity (for fixed invariants) upper-bounds retrocausal coordination:
                               Cperi = sup I(ι; Y ) subject to Ci (h) = 0 ∀i.                            (6)
                                           p(ι)
Practically, signals ride on variables orthogonal to the invariants; the code pins structure, not micro-
details.
5. Multiple loops and Schelling-Point Calculus
Consider a family {Lα }α∈A of loops with distinct durations τα but common constraint structure, encoded
by a dependency graph G and invariant set I = {Ik }. Write (G, I) for the structure type. [Structural
isomorphism] Loops Lα , Lβ are structurally isomorphic if there exists a bijection φ on nodes/edges of
G preserving the invariant set I (including the values of gauge-invariant holonomies). Agents inside
each loop choose an action aα = f (I1 , . . . , IK ) depending only on invariants (common knowledge across
structurally isomorphic loops). Let the Schelling functional be
                                                      X              
                                     S[f ] = E            1{aα = aβ } ,                                (7)
                                                          α̸=β
with expectation over exogenous periphery fluctuations consistent with C. A Schelling equilibrium is
an f ⋆ maximizing S. This yields coordinated focal choices across loops of different temporal lengths
without violating invariants or triggering paradoxes.

Temporal homotopy. If loop duration deforms continuously while (G, I) remains unchanged, the
class of equilibria f ⋆ is invariant. Thus, time extent can fluctuate while structure persists.
6. Complexity and existence
Computing a fixed point of a general self-referential L is PSPACE-hard in broad models of CTC
computation; uniqueness is regained under contractivity/monotonicity (e.g., Banach/Tarski–Knaster
frameworks). Practically: (i) identify an invariant subproblem with contraction to guarantee z ⋆ ; (ii)
treat the remaining periphery as free variables or sampled from an induced Gibbs-like measure consistent
with C.
7. Operational protocol
1. Identify invariants (the code). Empirically probe interventions; those aspects that revert under
   loop closure define I1 , . . . , IK .
2. Factor variables. Decompose x = (z, y) with z inside, y outside the invariant algebra.
3. Prove contractivity on targets. Establish conditions under which (4) has a unique z ⋆ (e.g.,
   Lipschitz constants < 1).
4. Exploit the periphery channel. Encode coordination in y while holding Ik fixed; upper-bound
   throughput via Cperi in (6).
5. Schelling selection. Choose f (I) that is simplest, symmetry-respecting, and salient under common
   knowledge to align across structurally isomorphic loops.
8. Empirical signatures
When acting on z:
• z exhibits reversion to a fixed value z ⋆ across attempts (low variance, sharp fixed point).
• Correlated shifts appear in y (high variance in periphery) without breaking gauge-invariants Ik .
• Across loops of differing durations, actions depending only on I align more reliably than actions
  depending on microstate features.
9. Summary schema

                                Code/invariants : I(h⋆ ) = I(L(h⋆ ))
                             No-target theorem : z ⋆ = F (z ⋆ ) (unique)
                                  Periphery channel : ι → p(y | C)
                    Schelling calculus : a = f (I) maximizes mutual predictability
