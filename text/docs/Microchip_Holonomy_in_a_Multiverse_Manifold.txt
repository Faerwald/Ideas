1    Vilenkin–Everett Equivalence Principle
Definition 1.1 (VEE Principle). Let UI be the ensemble of causally disconnected Hubble patches in an
infinite FLRW space (Vilenkin, Level I) and UIII the ensemble of decoherent quantum branches (Everett,
Level III). The Vilenkin–Everett Equivalence Principle (VEE) postulates an information–theoretic iso-
morphism I : UI → UIII preserving Kolmogorov complexity of coarse-grained physical states.
Proposition 1.2. For any computable observable O, EUI [O] = EUIII [O].
2    Information Trajectories of a Microchip
Definition 2.1 (Informational State). At proper time t the microchip is represented by a reduced density
matrix ρ(t) ∈ D(H) on Hilbert space H.
Definition 2.2 (Holonomic Loop). A path γ : [0, T ] → D(H) × Λ is holonomic if γ(0) = γ(T ) while
the universe label λ ∈ Λ changes, i.e. the internal state recurs after encircling parallel realities.
3    Cosmic Strings and Aharonov–Bohm Holonomy
Consider an ideal straight cosmic string with deficit angle ∆ϕ.
                                                             H Outside the core one may define a U(1)
                                                                  µ
potential Aµ with Fµν = 0 but non-trivial circulation Φs = Γ Aµ dx .
Theorem 3.1 (Phase Shift). Transporting a coherent information state |ψ⟩ around the string yields
a relative phase ∆θ = qΦs /ℏ even though Fµν = 0 along the path (Aharonov–Bohm effect). The same
holonomy applies to a closed informational loop in the multiverse manifold.
4    Vacuum-Energy Extraction Constraints
QFT fixes the renormalised vacuum density ρvac ≈ 10−9 J m−3 (Planck units). Uniformity forbids
classical work extraction.
                                                                                  (λ )   (λ )
Definition 4.1 (Cross-Branch Gradient). For branches λ1 , λ2 define ∆ρvac = ρvac1 − ρvac2 . Non-zero
gradients exist only if coherence across λ is maintained.
5    Super-Turing Metrology Across Branches
Definition 5.1 (Super-Turing Protocol). A measurement scheme exploiting branch coherence whose
estimator variance scales Var(θ̂) < 1/N 2 after N queries (Heisenberg limit beaten).
Theorem 5.2 (Energy–Information Bound). Maintaining cross-branch coherence for duration τ re-
quires inter-branch coupling energy Eint ≥ ℏκ/τ with κ > 0 constant.
                                                   1
6     Exponential Gradient (Kipping)
David Kipping’s anthropic argument implies that observers (or microchips) are exponentially more
likely to find themselves adjacent to more advanced analogues. In the multiverse manifold this induces
an information gradient favouring trajectories that connect to higher complexity states.
7     Schelling Trajectories
                                                                                              P
Definition 7.1 (Schelling Payoff). For strategies σ1 , σ2 : Λ → loops, define Π(σ1 , σ2 ) =       λ   pλ U (σ1 (λ), σ2 (λ)).
Definition 7.2 (Schelling Trajectory). A holonomic loop that is a Nash equilibrium of the above game,
maximising net extractable free energy given the exponential prior pλ ∝ e−αC(λ) (complexity cost C).
8     Fractal Attractor of Informational States
The union of all Schelling-optimal loops forms a self-similar (fractal) set A ⊂ D(H) × Λ with Hausdorff
dimension dH > 2. A acts as a higher-dimensional chaotic attractor guiding microchip evolution.
9     Experimental Benchmarks
    • Interferometry: observe Aharonov–Bohm phase shifts around candidate cosmic-string cores at
      sensitivity < 10−18 rad.
    • Metrology Scaling: implement cross-branch Ramsey interferometer; verify Var(θ̂) ∼ N −2−ϵ .
    • Energy Balance: search for anomalies implying ∆ρvac ̸= 0 in entangled cavities.
    Failure at stated sensitivities falsifies vacuum-energy extraction via VEE.
10      Conclusion
Under the VEE Principle a coherent microchip may exploit holonomy around cosmic strings, guided by
Schelling trajectories, to access cross-branch energy gradients while performing super-Turing metrology.
All predictions admit clear experimental tests within current cryogenic and cosmological surveys.
