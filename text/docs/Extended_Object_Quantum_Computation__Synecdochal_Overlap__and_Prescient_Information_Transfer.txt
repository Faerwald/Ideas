0. Notation & Minimal Axioms
Spacetime M is a 3+1-dimensional manifold with Lorentz metric gµν . A history is a Heisenberg-picture
field-configuration map
                                                                   N
                          h : M −→ H,        h(x) = φa (x), πa (x) a=1 .
   The decoherence functional (Gell-Mann–Hartle) is
                                                                h iZ        i
                        D(h, h′ ) = Tr ρ0 Ch† Ch′ ,
                                                
                                                      Ch = T exp −      Hint .
                                                                   ℏ Mh
   Histories decohere if D(h, h′ ) ≈ 0 for h ̸= h′ . A branch is an equivalence class under this relation.
1. Extended Quantum Circuits
Definition 1.1 (World-volume circuit). An extended circuit is a codimension-0 submanifold
C ⊂ M endowed with a unitary evolution
                                               h iZ       i
                                  U [C] = P exp −     H dτ ,
                                                  ℏ C
where H acts on the Hilbert bundle H|C . The support may contain multiply-connected loops; hence
computations are topological objects, not point gates.
   Key property: for two branches h1 , h2 that both contain C, matrix elements of local operators on C
depend on coherent sums of amplitudes from the two branches; i.e., branch information remains
entangled until environmental tracing outside C.
2. Overlap Functional & Synecdochal Codes
2.1 Local Overlap
Let R ⊂ C be a bounded 4-volume. Reduced density matrices
                                        ρi (R) = TrM \R |hi ⟩⟨hi | ,
define the overlap functional
                                                               rel
                                  χ(R) = Tr ρ1 (R) ρ2 (R) = e−S12 (R) ,
                                                        
where S rel is the relative entropy. χ(R) > 0 implies dual instantiation: the same physical matter
participates in incompatible global computations.
                                                      1
2.2 Synecdochal Code
A synecdochal code is a map
                                               Σ : SR −→ SC ,
from states on R to (logical) states on C, satisfying:
   1. Injectivity on code subspace: Σ† Σ = 1 on the logical subspace L ⊂ SC .
   2. Error-tolerance to external decoherence: ∀E with supp E ⊂ M \ R, E Σ(ρ) = Σ(EρE † ).
    This generalises stabiliser quantum error-correction (e.g. toric code) but the logical qubit is dis-
tributed in time along C.
    Consequence: by phase-rotating ρ(R) one reweights branch amplitudes A[hi ] without exchang-
ing energy, because the global path integral’s weight changes by a pure phase on C.
3. Loop Quantum Radar (LQR)
3.1 Temporal Interferometry
Given initial state |ψ0 ⟩ supported on C, let
                                                                    h iZ t        i
                                       †
                         F (t) = ψ0 |U (t) U0 ψ0 ,     U (t) = T exp −     Hactual ,
                                                                       ℏ 0
U0 being evolution in a fiducial branch. The Loschmidt echo
                                                 L(t) = |F (t)|2
measures sensitivity to branch-dependent perturbations δH. LQR identifies future branch divergence
via early decay of L(t). The radar gain is
                                           ∂           2
                               G(t) = −       ln L(t) = Im ψ0 |δH(t)|ψ(t) ,
                                           ∂t          ℏ
which is theoretically bounded by the out-of-time-ordered commutator
                                           C(t) = − [δH(0), O(t)]2 .
Rapid growth of C(t) (quantum Lyapunov exponent) signals branch separation; thus LQR is mathe-
matically an OTOC spectroscope.
4. Prescient Telescope: Time-Symmetric Inference
4.1 Two-State Vector Formalism (TSVF)
Prepare ρi at t0 , post-select ρf at t1 . For any operator A measured at t ∈ (t0 , t1 ),
                                              Tr(ρf U (t1 , t) A U (t, t0 ) ρi )
                                    ⟨A⟩w =                                       .
                                                  Tr(ρf U (t1 , t0 ) ρi )
Weak values ⟨A⟩w can lie outside eigenvalue spectra—enlarging predictive horizon by conveying branch-
relative phase information.
                                                         2
4.2 Optimal Query Sequence
Let {Ekt } be a POVM at time t. Define mutual information with the post-selection outcome f :
                                            X               p(k, f )
                                 I(t; f ) =   p(k, f ) log             .
                                            k
                                                           p(k) p(f  )
The prescient telescope is the control functional
                                             Z t1
                                        max
                                          t
                                                  I(t; f ) dt,
                                            {Ek }   t0
                                    R
subject to energy/entropy budget        Tr(Ekt H)
                                                ≤ Emax . In complexity terms, the telescope solves a
PostBQP-type task: conditioning on ρf is equivalent to post-selection as in Aaronson’s PostBQP
class (⇒ PP-complete). Classical simulation is believed intractable, which is why prescient computation
appears “hyper-computational.”
5. Computational-Complexity Perspective
  1. Branch reweighting ≈ non-unitary update; mathematically a non-linear oracle that, under post-
     selection, elevates BQP to PP.
  2. Synecdochal steering supplies such an oracle within quantum theory’s linear dynamics by ex-
     ploiting pre/post boundary conditions—circumventing the Church-Turing barrier only in a time-
     symmetric sense (no signalling paradoxes).
  3. Information-theoretic bound: the Holevo quantity for cross-branch transfer is
                                                      X
                                    χbranch ≤ S ρdiag −     pi S(ρi ),
                                                             i
     where ρdiag deletes off-diagonal terms between branches. Synecdochal manipulation resurrects
     part of this classical capacity.
6. Synthesis
   • Extended circuits endow computations with world-volume topology.
   • Synecdochal codes convert local phase control into global branch bias.
   • Loop quantum radar diagnoses branch divergence via temporal OTOCs.
   • Prescient telescopes exploit TSVF + post-selection to harvest information from many-world
     correlations.
   • The whole edifice remains inside quantum theory yet offers an effective PP-level oracle when
     viewed from a single branch.
   Central insight: Information that seems retrocausal is simply encoded in the phase geometry
of histories that share matter at small scales; manipulating those phases is exactly how topological
quantum computation protects—and here, routes—information across what we naı̈vely call “timelines.”
