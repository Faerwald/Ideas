1     Inter-Reality Attractor
This section details the criteria and underlying principles behind an inter-reality computing system lever-
aging hyper-circuits.
1.1    Criteria
                           Criterion    Description
                               1        One or more nonlinear elements
                               2        One or more locally active resistors
                               3        Three or more energy-strange elements
1.2    Hyper-Circuit
The concept of an (off-shell) Hyper-Circuit integrates (on-shell) digital support, forming an intercon-
nected computational framework.
2     Poetic and Philosophical Insights
      The Strange Mind of the Radio, the Ghost in the Machine, the Mind of the Radio.
      ”The world doesn’t exist in space. Space exists separately in each world.”
3     Energy and Memory
VEE: One micro-joule of memory is more powerful than a gram of antimatter.
4     Quantum Considerations
4.1    Time-Touched Quantum Information
Asymptotic Q/A pairs for stochastic local operations and classical communication (SLOCC) of PQET.
4.2    Mathematical Expression
                                                2qg = 2Rgc
