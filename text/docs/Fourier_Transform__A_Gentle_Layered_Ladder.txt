Fourier Transform: A Gentle Layered Ladder
                               ⟨Jason Agamemnon Sokaris | .F.A.E.R.W.A.L.D⟩
Step 1 — The Big Idea
The Fourier transform is a tool for looking at something in a different way. It takes a thing that changes over
time (a sound, an image line by line, any signal) and shows you what it is made of in terms of pure, simple
waves.
 • Listening to a musical chord, your ear and brain split it into notes: “That’s a C, an E, and a G.” The
   Fourier transform is a precise machine that does this for any signal.
 • Instead of telling you “what it is doing right now,” it tells you which waves are inside: their frequencies
   (wiggle speed), their strengths (how big), and their shifts (where the wave starts).
Step 2 — The Two Worlds
You can think of the Fourier transform as a translator between two languages:
1. Time domain. The original picture: “What value do I have at each moment of time?” Example: the
   pressure wave your microphone records.
2. Frequency domain. The ingredient list: “How much of each pure wave (frequency) is present?” Example:
   which musical notes appear, and how loud they are.
The Fourier transform goes from time to frequency. The inverse Fourier transform goes back from frequency
to time.
Step 3 — The Shape of the Formula
The common (engineering) form is                    Z   ∞
                                         F (f ) =           x(t) e− i 2πf t dt.
                                                    −∞
Here:
• x(t)
  Z — the signal: a number for each time t.
     ∞
•        · · · dt — an integral : a way to add up tiny contributions from every moment.
    −∞
• f — the frequency we are asking about (wiggles per second).
• e−i2πf t — a pure wave in compact notation. The complex exponential encodes both cosine and sine at once.
• x(t) · e−i2πf t — the match between your signal and that pure wave. Summing it over all time measures how
  much of that frequency is present.
Step 4 — The Intuition of Each Piece
1. The signal x(t). Imagine a squiggly line on a graph of time vs. value. It could be your voice, a heartbeat,
   or the brightness of a star.
2. The pure wave e−i2πf t .
    • This represents a perfect sinusoidal wiggle.
    • The symbol i (the imaginary unit) lets one write cosine and sine together compactly; it is a bookkeeping
      device that makes wave math tidy.
3. Multiplying x(t) by the wave.
    • If the signal and the test wave “line up,” their product tends to add coherently.
    • If they do not, the product flips sign and cancels when added.
                                                            1
4. The integral (sum over time).
   • This is the overall score for frequency f : how strongly the signal contains a wave of that frequency.
   • Like listening for one note throughout an entire song.
Step 5 — Why It Works
Imagine a jumble of colored lights. Each color is like a frequency. If you use a filter that only passes one color,
you see how much of that color is present. The Fourier transform does this for waves: it isolates one frequency
at a time and measures its strength.
Step 6 — What You Get Out
The output F (f ) is a complex number (two parts in one):
• The magnitude |F (f )| tells how much of that frequency is present.
• The phase arg F (f ) tells where that wave starts (its offset).
Plotting |F (f )| versus f gives a spectrum, like a rainbow for sound, showing which frequencies are present and
how strong they are.
Roadmap. The appendices expand the six-item “full tree” in simple language and precise mathematics:
A. What is a wave?
B. What is frequency?
C. What is eiθ ?
D. What is an integral?
E. Why does multiplication act like matching?
F. How the whole thing works together (including inverse transform, discrete case, sampling).
Appendix A — What Is a Wave?
Plain words. A wave is a repeating up-and-down pattern. The simplest possible wave is a smooth “wiggle”
that repeats forever with the same shape.
Mathematics.      A pure (cosine) wave of amplitude A > 0, frequency f > 0 (in Hz), and phase ϕ is
                                            w(t) = A cos(2πf t + ϕ).
A sine wave is A sin(2πf t + ϕ). A traveling wave in space and time can be
                                        w(x, t) = A cos(2πf t − kx + ϕ),
where k is the spatial wavenumber (how many ripples per unit length). The complex form (see Appendix C)
writes both at once as
                                        w(t) = ℜ Aei(2πf t+ϕ) .
                                                 
Appendix B — What Is Frequency?
Plain words. Frequency says “how fast the wiggle repeats”—how many cycles per second. The period T is
“how long one cycle takes.”
                                                         1
Mathematics.      Frequency f and period T satisfy f =     , with units: f in Hz (s−1 ), T in seconds. Angular
                                                        T
frequency ω = 2πf (radians per second) is convenient for formulas. A sinusoid is
                                   w(t) = A cos(ωt + ϕ) = A cos(2πf t + ϕ).
Changing ϕ slides the wave left or right in time without changing f or A.
                                                        2
Appendix C — What Is eiθ ?
Plain words. eiθ is a compact way to describe a rotating pointer on a circle. As time passes, the pointer
spins; its horizontal and vertical shadows are cosine and sine.
Mathematics (Euler’s formula).
                                                         eiθ = cos θ + i sin θ,
where i is the imaginary unit (i2 = −1). Thus
                                 Aei(2πf t+ϕ) = A cos(2πf t + ϕ) + i A sin(2πf t + ϕ).
This single object conveniently encodes both cosine and sine. Algebra with exponentials is simpler:
                                              eiα · eiβ = ei(α+β) ,                       eiθ = e−iθ .
In Fourier analysis we pair signals with e−i2πf t ; the overline naturally appears because we use a complex inner
product.
Appendix D — What Is an Integral?
Plain words. An integral is an idealized sum. Break time into tiny slices, multiply “value in the slice” by
“slice width,” and add. Let the slices become infinitely thin: that limit (when it exists) is the integral.
Mathematics (Riemann sum idea).                      Divide R into small intervals of width ∆t. Then
                                                    Z    b                      X
                                                             x(t) dt ≈              x(tk ) ∆t,
                                                     a                          k
and the approximation becomes exact as ∆t → 0 (under standard conditions). In the Fourier transform, we
integrate the product x(t) ei2πf t ; this is an inner product in the function space L2 (R):
                                                         Z ∞
                                               ⟨f, g⟩ =      f (t) g(t) dt.
                                                                          −∞
Orthogonality (“perpendicularity”) means ⟨f, g⟩ = 0; complex exponentials at different frequencies are (distri-
butionally) orthogonal over infinite time.
Appendix E — Why Does Multiplication Act Like Matching?
Plain words. Multiply your signal by a pure test wave and add over time. If they match, positive parts line
up with positive, negative with negative, so the sum grows. If they do not match, ups cancel downs and the
sum stays small.
Mathematics (orthogonality). For distinct frequencies f ̸= f ′ ,
                                                                                               sin 2π(f − f ′ )T
                        Z   T                                 Z   T
                                                                                                                 
                                                                          i2π(f −f ′ )t
                                ei2πf t ei2πf ′ t   dt =              e                   dt =                     ,
                         −T                                    −T                                  π (f − f ′ )
which tends to 0 as T → ∞. When f = f ′ the integral tends to 2T , i.e., it grows large. This is the continuous-
time version of the exponentials’ orthogonality and explains why
                                                   Z
                                          F (f ) = x(t) e−i2πf t dt
measures the amount of frequency f in x.
Inner-product viewpoint. The Fourier transform is the inner product of x with the basis function t 7→
ei2πf t . The magnitude |F (f )| is the projection length; the phase arg F (f ) is the alignment angle.
                                                                            3
Appendix F — How It All Works Together
F.1 Forward and inverse transforms
With the (2π-in-frequency) engineering convention,
                                  Z ∞                                               Z   ∞
                         F (f ) =     x(t) e−i2πf t dt,                    x(t) =           F (f ) ei2πf t df.
                                       −∞                                            −∞
(Mathematicians often use angular frequency ω = 2πf and place factors of 2π differently; all conventions are
equivalent when paired correctly.)
F.2 Energy and Parseval
Energy is preserved under the transform (Parseval/Plancherel):
                                      Z ∞             Z ∞
                                                2
                                          |x(t)| dt =     |F (f )|2 df.
                                            −∞                             −∞
So the spectrum |F (f )|2 tells how the signal’s energy is distributed across frequencies.
F.3 Discrete data, DFT, and FFT
                                  1
If you sample x(t) at rate fs =   Ts   and collect N samples x[0], . . . , x[N − 1], the discrete Fourier transform
(DFT) is
                                            N −1
                                            X                     kn
                               X[k] =              x[n] e− i 2π   N    ,        k = 0, . . . , N − 1.
                                            n=0
Its fast algorithm (FFT) computes all X[k] in O(N log N ) time.
Sampling and Nyquist. To represent frequencies up to fmax without aliasing, sample faster than twice
that: fs > 2fmax (Nyquist rate). Frequencies above fs /2 fold back (alias).
F.4 Windows and spectrograms (changing over time)
If the signal changes over time (e.g., a siren), analyze short chunks. The short-time Fourier transform (STFT)
multiplies by a window w(t − τ ) before transforming:
                                                  Z
                                        S(τ, f ) = x(t) w(t − τ ) e−i2πf t dt.
Plotting |S(τ, f )| shows what frequencies are present when. Different window widths trade time resolution for
frequency resolution.
F.5 Convolution and filtering
Convolution in time becomes multiplication in frequency:
                                             (x ∗ h)(t) ←→ F (f ) H(f ).
Designing a filter is choosing H(f ) to keep wanted frequencies and suppress unwanted ones.
F.6 Cautions and assumptions
• Ideal formulas assume infinite-time data; in practice we have finite windows (use windows/tapers to reduce
  artifacts).
• A good clock is assumed; on curved spacetimes or irregular domains, use geometry-aware “Fourier-like”
  modes (eigenfunctions of appropriate operators).
• Complex numbers are bookkeeping; final physical predictions can be taken as real parts or magnitudes/phases.
