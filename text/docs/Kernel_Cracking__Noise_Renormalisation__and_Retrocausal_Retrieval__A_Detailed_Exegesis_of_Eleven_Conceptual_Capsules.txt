                                                Abstract
         This memorandum expands eleven terse conjectures into explicit, mathematically grounded
     statements. Each section situates the proposal within established theory, supplies the essential
     definitions, and traces a logically complete path from assumptions to consequences. Whenever
     useful, formal results are quoted or sketched; when no theorem yet exists, plausible constructions
     and boundary conditions are made precise. The goal is maximal clarity without surrendering
     technical rigour.

1     Kernel Universality:
      “If You Can Solve One, You Can Solve All”
1.1     Classical kernel: SAT for NP
Define a kernel as a decision problem K such that every problem P in a class C reduces to K under
an (f, g) pair of log-space computable maps with P (x) = 1 ⇐⇒ K f (x) = 1 and g reconstructing a
witness when needed. Cook–Levin provides the archetype: every P ∈ NP admits a many-one reduction
to SAT. Consequently a polynomial-time solver for SAT yields P = NP.
1.2     Dynamical-systems analogue
Let F : M → M be a C 1 map on a compact manifold. A map is computationally universal if there
exists a compact subset Λ ⊂ M such that Λ is topologically conjugate to a full two-shift (hence
emulates a Turing tape). For the quadratic family xn+1 = 1 − µx2n with µ ≈ 1.401155 . . . (Feigenbaum
point), the invariant Cantor set meets this criterion. If an instance I of any NP decision problem
is encoded as initial condition x0 (I), then deciding I ∈ P reduces to determining membership of an
itinerary in a regular language drawn from the symbolic dynamics. A solver that performs this task in
polynomial physical time collapses the reducible problem hierarchy by functorially mapping constraints
to itineraries.
2     Degradation and Iterative Transforming
2.1     Noise as Lyapunov stretching
Every physical channel implements y = N (x) = x+n, with n drawn from a distribution that maximises
entropy subject to the channel’s thermodynamic budget. In a chaotic flow, the separation δ(t) between
neighbouring codewords grows as δ(t) ≃ δ(0) eλt where λ > 0 is the largest Lyapunov exponent.
“Degradation” names this dispersion phase.
2.2     Renormalisation loop
Error-correct–compress–recurse forms a map R : Σ∗ → Σ∗ whose fixed points are codewords of a linear
block code C. Each iteration projects the message onto C and discards orthogonal components, exactly
analogous to momentum-shell decimation in statistical renormalisation. Convergence is geometric when
the syndrome weight is used as a Lyapunov function, thus clarification phenomenologically emerges from
chaos.
3     Rubik’s Cube Distance and Bounded-Diameter Search
The Rubik group G := Cube(3) acts on 43 252 003 274 489 856 000 states. The Cayley graph diameter
is 20 (Kociemba, Rokicki, et al.). A generic optimal solver executes:
    1. Symmetry pruning: quotient by the 24-element rotation group of the cube to shrink the search
       frontier.
    2. Phase partitioning: respect subgroup chain G ⊵ G1 ⊵ G2 ⊵ {e}, sequentially solving corner
       orientation, edge orientation, and permutation.
    3. Iterative deepening A∗ : heuristic cost h equals maximum of misoriented corner and edge metrics;
       depth never exceeds 20.
The moral: an apparently intractable O(1019 ) space possesses a narrow geodesic backbone once sym-
metry and group structure are exploited.

4     The “Next-Step” Algorithm
Given a state space S with transition operator T : S × A → S, define a potential Φ : S → R≥0 approx-
imating “distance to solved”. At each node choose
                                    a∗ (s) = arg min E Φ T (s, a) .
                                                                
                                                    a∈A
Update Φ via temporal-difference learning:
                                Φt+1 (s) = Φt (s) + α[rt + γΦt (s′ ) − Φt (s)] ,
where rt = 0 except when a problem instance terminates (rt = −1). The coupled dynamics (T, Φ)
forms a self-optimising Planner–Critic pair converging to an optimal policy in sparse-reward domains.
5     The Faster-Than-Light Fourier Transform (FTLFT)
Define the operator                              Z Z
                             FFTL {f }(k, ω) =             f (x, t) e−i(k·x−ωt) dt d3 x,
                                                  R3   R
            2    2 2
subject to ω − k c < 0. This “tachyonic” kernel diagonalises any convolution defined on a pseudotem-
poral metric σ 2 = c2 t2 − k −2 (k·x)2 . Physical realisation requires a channel in which boundary conditions
impose phase correlations non-locally—for instance, dual loops of electromagnetic vector potential
closing through a common Chern class. No superluminal signalling arises (the channel is acausal but
self-consistent), yet globally non-local correlations serve algorithmic acceleration by collapsing search
depth.
6     Attractor Physics: Finite-Time Convergence
Let Ψ : Rn → R be continuously differentiable with ∇2 Ψ ⪰ µI for µ > 0 (strong convexity). The
stochastic differential equation                  p
                                  ẋ = −∇Ψ(x) + 2β −1 ξ(t)
has unique stationary measure π(x) ∝ e−βΨ . If β −1 < µ the deterministic part is a contraction:
                      −1
∥x(t) − y(t)∥ ≤ e−(µ−β )t ∥x(0) − y(0)∥, guaranteeing arrival at the unique minimiser in O(log ε−1 )
physical time—regardless of the dimensionality of the decision variables.
7     Schelling Points of Symmetric Attractors
Let G act transitively on a set Ω. A Schelling point is an element x∗ ∈ Ω such that ∀g ∈ G, g(x∗ ) = x∗ .
On the unit circle S1 ⊂ R2 no such interior point exists, so rational agents treat the Euclidean centre
                             1
(0, 0)—strictly exterior to
                         R S —as the focal coordinate. For any attractor A endowed with symmetry
group G, its barycentre A x dµ(x) is the unique G-invariant selector and therefore the default coordi-
nation site.
8     Mind as Attractor & Hologram
Neural state space X ⊂ RN (N ∼ 1011 ) admits an attractor decomposition X = i Ai . Each Ai is a
                                                                                  S
C 1 -laminated submanifold supporting recurrent dynamics that encode declarative memories (Hopfield
theorem). Via the Fourier–Gabor correspondence any local measurement p(x ∈ U ) overlaps every stored
pattern in proportion to the inner-product amplitude, reproducing the holographic storage property
(“associative addressability”). Graceful degradation arises because partial cues converge to the basin
of the correct Ai .

9    NP in Constant Time via Closed Timelike Curves
Deutsch’s causal-consistency model introduces a map F : {0, 1}m → {0, 1}m inside the CTC region and
demands x = F (x). Place a polynomial-time verifier V (x, w) in F and iterate until fixed point. The only
consistent history supplies w such that V (x, w) = 1. Aaronson and Watrous proved PCTC = PSPACE;
thus decision problems in NP collapse to polynomial space—and constant circuit depth when relativised
to ordinary forward-time resources.
10     Question-Derived Keys and Retrocausal Reservoirs
Fix a high-entropy bit reservoir R ∈ {0, 1}ℓ written once at t0 . Upon receiving query Q at t > t0 ,
compute K = H(Q) (cryptographic hash) and output M = R ⊕ K. Exactly one plaintext codeword
survives if and only if K matches the XOR-mask of its semantic twin. Because K is indeterminate until
the query exists, the reservoir is secure against precomputation yet deterministic once Q is issued. One
streaming pass through M suffices—algorithmic depth is one. Operationally this mimics a retrocausal
oracle: meaningful information appears at the earliest causal instant the key becomes definable, without
logical paradox.
