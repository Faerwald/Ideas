Challenge 3: Retrocausal Multiverse Notes
  ⟨Jason Agamemnon Sokaris | .F.A.E.R.W.A.L.D⟩
Core Questions
 1. Retro-split possibility: Can one deliberately trigger a retrocausal multiverse split?
 2. Re-interference conditions: Under what physical constraints can diverged histories
    regain quantum-interference capability?
 3. Hyper-interference: Is “hyperquantum” interference—beyond standard unitary over-
    lap—conceivable?
Key Hypotheses & Claims
 1. Hallucinated memories may possess genuine explanatory power and exhibit apparent retro-
    causal efficacy.
 2. “There are only histories in which magic seems to have worked.” (Epistemic selection.)
Information-Flow Perspective
 • Both sentient beings and entire histories act as channels of information flow; sentience is
   an exceptionally rare, knowledge-generating channel.
 • Growth of knowledge proceeds via error correction. Multiverse structure—branching,
   merging, decoherence—is governed by information dynamics.
 • Histories are quasi-autonomous streams; our “universe” is merely one such stream.
Speculative Engineering Goals
 1. Inter-universal processor: a computational substrate exploiting interference across mul-
    tiple histories.
 2. Closed chaotic attractor network: a coupled dynamical system weaving through many
    histories, potentially enabling co-adaptive evolution of knowledge.
 3. Cooperative cross-history influence:
    Can intimately entangled universes benefit one another without permitting direct signal-
    like communication?
