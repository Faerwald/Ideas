                                                 Abstract
         This document refines and extends the previous eleven conceptual capsules, adding rigorous
     definitions, explicit theorems, and constructive proofs. A twelfth section formalises the faulty-
     switch circuit for resolving closed-timelike paradoxes, derived from recently digitised notes. All
     probabilistic arguments are made measure-theoretic; dynamical claims are supported by Lyapunov
     or contractive estimates; and complexity assertions are tied to precise reductions. Citations to the
     primary working notes are included for archival fidelity.:contentReference[oaicite:0]index=0

1     Kernel Universality
1.1    Reductions in Complexity Theory
Let K be poly-complete for a class C ⊆ P#P if every P ∈ C admits an (f, g) pair of log-space computable
maps,                                                          
                 P (x) = 1 ⇐⇒ K f (x) = 1,           and g x, w ∈ Witness(P, x),                    (1)
with |w| polynomial in |x|. Cook–Levin instantiates K with SAT, yielding P = NP iff K ∈ P.
1.2    Chaotic Map Kernel
Let Fµ (x) = 1 − µx2 on [−1, 1]. For µ = µFeig ≈ 1.401155, the maximal invariant set Λµ is conjugate
to the full Bernoulli two-shift Σ2 via a Hölder homeomorphism h : Λµ → Σ2 . Encoding an instance I
of an NP problem as x0 (I) ∈ Λµ transforms membership queries into finite-time itinerary membership
in a regular language L ⊂ Σ∗2 . A physical oracle capable of distinguishing L in polynomial wall-clock
time therefore polynomialises every reducible problem.
2     Degradation & Iterative Transforming
2.1    Channel Noise as Entropy Production
Given a channel
                N : M → M with statistical operator ρy|x , define the message divergence D(t) =
KL ρyt ∥ ρy∞ . For a Markov semigroup with generator L satisfying a log-Sobolev constant α, one has
D(t) ≤ D(0)e−2αt , identifying “degradation” with Lyapunov stretching.
2.2    Renormalisation Loop as Contractive Map
Let C ⊂ Σn be a linear [n, k, d] code and ΠC =c∈C wH (m − c) the nearest-codeword projector. Define
R = ΠC ◦ C where C is a rate-λ compressor. Then,
                        wH R(m) − R(m′ ) ≤ λwH m − m′ ,
                                                         
                                                                 0 < λ < 1,                     (2)
so R is a strict contraction in Hamming space, guaranteeing geometric convergence to a codeword.

4.1    Potential-Shaping
                                                                         

P                 P min2
                         a E Φ(T (s, a)) . Convergence follows from standard TD-learning theory under
    α
   t t = ∞    and    α
                    t t  < ∞.

5      Faster-Than-Light Fourier Transform
Define the operator
                              ZZ
                                 f (x, t) exp −i(k · x − ωt) dt d3 x,   s.t. ω 2 − k 2 c2 < 0.
                                                           
             FFTL {f }(k, ω) =
                               R3 R
                                                                                2
The kernel diagonalises convolution over the pseudo-metric σ 2 = c2 t2 − (k·x)
                                                                           k2
                                                                               . Physical instantiation
utilises vector-potential loops sharing a Chern class n ̸= 0, enforcing global phase locking without
superluminal information flow.
6      Contractive Attractor Dynamics
[Finite-Time Convergence] Let ẋ = −∇Ψ(x) + η(t) with η an Itô noise of variance β −1 . If ∇2 Ψ ⪰ µI
                                                    −1
and β −1 < µ, then ∥x(t) − x∗ ∥ ≤ ∥x(0) − x∗ ∥e−(µ−β )t , so x(t) reaches an ε-ball in O(log ε−1 ) time
independent of n.
7      Schelling Points of Symmetric Attractors
RFor a compact attractor A with symmetry group G acting ergodically, define the barycentre x̄ =
  A
    x dµ(x). Then Gx̄ = x̄, and by common-knowledge recursion (Aumann), rational agents coordinate
 on x̄.
8      Mind as Attractor and Hologram
Let FS : X → X be Lipschitz on a compact Hilbert ball X ⊂ RN , N ∼ 1011 . The attractor decomposition
X = i Ai yields F t (U ) → Ai for U ⊂ Basin(Ai ). A partial cue u ∈ U converges to Ai iff ⟨u, ϕj ⟩ > θ
for a sufficient set of Gabor modes {ϕj }. Thus content-addressability and graceful degradation follow.
9      NP in Constant Time with CTCs
                                                                
Deutsch’s fixed-point equation x = F (x) with F (x) = x ⊕ V π(x) forces V to output a valid witness
π(x); else no fixed point exists. Aaronson–Watrous embed this into a P oracle, proving PCTC =
PSPACE.
10      Question-Derived Keys & Retrocausal Reservoirs
Given reservoir R ∈ {0, 1}ℓ and query hash K = H(Q), output M = R ⊕ K. Unique decoding
succeeds iff there exists a w ∈ W such that H(Q) = H(w), which holds with probability 2−ℓ under
preimage-resistant H. Storage cost is fixed at ℓ while security inherits the second-preimage resistance
of H.
11      Probabilistic Faulty-Switch Circuit
11.1    Model Definition
Consider a discrete-time Markov chain on state Σ = {0, 1} × Z≥0 where the first coordinate denotes
“timeline parity” and the second the iteration count. The faulty switch at iteration n fires with
probability                   (
                               pact , if activated,
                         pn =                        0 < pidle ≪ pact < 1.                     (3)
                               pidle , if idle,
                                                   3
Activation toggles the parity bit; idle firing initiates an unsolicited toggle. Empirical values pact = 0.9,
pidle = 0.01 arise from the working notes.:contentReference[oaicite:1]index=1
11.2     Loop-Breaking Probability
Let T be the stopping time at which the system first attains parity 1 (“desired divergence”). The chain
is absorbing at parity 1 because future self-consistency prohibits further toggles from that branch. For
constant probabilities, P(T ≤ N ) = 1 − (1 − pact )N , so E[T ] = (1 − pact )−1 .
11.3     Quantum Implementation
Following the notes, on-shell signals encode classical bits while off-shell (virtual) modes supply the
stochastic perturbation. The effective switch Hamiltonian is H = H0 + λσx ⊗ ϕ, with ϕ a vacuum field
operator. Integrating out ϕ yields a GKS-Lindblad term Lρ = γ(σx ρσx − ρ), producing the required
probabilistic flip with γ∆t = pidle .:contentReference[oaicite:2]index=2
11.4     Resolution of Grandfather-Type Paradoxes
Let G represent the deterministic “kill” action, and S the switch super-operator. The composite map
per cycle is C = S ◦ G. Because S is stochastic, the composite has spectral radius < 1 on the subspace
of paradox-inducing histories, ensuring almost-sure absorption into a self-consistent branch.
    [Finite-Expectation Paradox Resolution] Given 0 < pact ≤ 1 and pidle > 0, the expected number of
                                                                                   1
retroactive interventions required to reach a paradox-free branch equals E[T ] = pact .
Proof. Immediate from the geometric distribution of successful toggles under independent trials.
