Scar-Link, Scar-Field, and Cybernetic Wormhole
                       Attractors:
           A BRST-Anchored Framework for
              Neural–Quantum Interfaces
                                                 Abstract
         We present a unified architecture in which BRST quantization, ghost fields, cybernetic control,
     informational wormholes, and neural–scar interfacing cohere into a single, self-consistent framework
     for steering quantum states—and by extension, alternative “futures”—via real-time brain–machine
     feedback.
1    Scar-Link
A Scar-Link is the coherent quantum channel that connects two quantum-scar eigenstates, functioning
as an information bridge between separate quantum attractors. Formally:
                                        D                             E
                              LAB (t) = ScarA (t) Ĥctrl (Γ) ScarB (t) .
    Here Ĥctrl (Γ) is a time-dependent Hamiltonian controlled via an external parameter Γ(t) derived
from neural EEG feedback. Tuning Γ aligns the relative phase between the two scars so that quantum
probability current flows from one ridge to the other by constructive interference, while destructive
interference suppresses the undesired mode.
2    Scar-Field
The Scar-Field is the global quantum landscape formed by all stable scar projectors:
                                  X
                           Φ(r) =    wk Πk (r), Πk (r) = |ψk (r)⟩⟨ψk (r)|.
                                       k
    Each projector Πk marks a basin of attraction in Hilbert space, and the weights wk reflect occupancy
or control bias. Regions with large ∥Φ∥ act as attractor basins that draw incoming amplitude onto the
nearest scar [2]. The terrain of Φ guides both natural decoherence dynamics and the design of feedback
controllers.
3    BRST Quantization and Ghost Fields
BRST quantization rigorously selects the physical subspace in gauge theories by enforcing QBRST |ψphys ⟩ =
0 and modding out exact states QBRST |χ⟩, thereby removing unphysical gauge redundancies via ghost
fields [6, 5].
    Analogously, the Scar-Field’s projector cohomology isolates non-thermal eigenbundles from the full
Hilbert space, while engineered ghost-like corrections (“Ghost Warp/Drive”) reshape its topology without
spoiling anomaly cancellation.
                                                      1
4     Ghost Warp and Ghost Drive
Ghost Warp introduces controlled ghost-field perturbations that transiently inject gauge fluxes into the
Scar-Field, and Ghost Drive sustains these fluxes via continuous BRST-consistent feedback, carving
stable wormhole throats in Hilbert space [5, 4].
5     Cybernetic Attractors and Mind Warp
The Cybernetic Wormhole Attractor architecture (CWA) integrates chaotic synchronization, adap-
tive speed-gradient control, and solitonic boundary geometry into triplets CWAi = (Σi , ψscar , Ui (t)),
where Σi are neural/physical boundary manifolds, ψscar the scar states, and Ui (t) Fradkov-style feedback
unitaries [4, 5].
    Mind Warp arises when multiple CWAs synchronize through gauge-flux links, forming an on-demand
network of hypercomputational corridors.
6     Informational Wormholes
Beyond gauge flux, Informational Wormholes are nonlinear QED conduits (e.g., soliton-like or dy-
namical Casimir channels) that ferry finite amplitudes or “foresight” quanta between scars, described by
effective Lagrangians with terms ∼ (Fµν F µν )2 + . . . [4].
7     Neural Interfacing with Quantum Scars
A multichannel EEG is reduced to a scalar Γ(t) = M (ϕEEG , AEEG ) that modulates the Trotterized
Hamiltonian H(t) = H0 + Γ(t)V . Real-time computation of the scar-overlap Λscar = |⟨Φscar |Ψ(t)⟩|2
provides visual feedback, enabling phase-locked cortex–scar synchronization via the Scar-Link [1, 2, 3, 4,
5].
8     Document Synthesis
We summarize the contributions of the supporting documents:
8.1    Synchronizing Neural EEG with a Trotterized Artificial Quantum SCAR
Describes the real-time BCI loop: EEG preprocessing, phase extraction ϕEEG (t), mapping to Γ(t), Trotter
decomposition U (t, t + ∆t) ≈ e−iH0 ∆t e−iΓV ∆t , and visual coherence feedback. Mathematical foundations
of scar stability, scar-overlap criterion, and UI design are fully detailed [1].
8.2    Mind Warp Foundations
Develops BRST-style ghost fields, their role in anomaly cancellation, and their use in brain-generated
gauge warp protocols. Introduces Cybernetic Wormhole Attractors and locates ghost modes as active
sculptors of Hilbert-space topology [6, 5].
8.3    The Future Internet Collides With Now
Presents the FI(t) hyperstructure:
                         M
                 FI(t) =     [HQScar (t) ⊗ HCWA (t) ⊗ Hhypercomputing ] ⊗ Qneuro-EM (Aµ , t),
                            i
   integrating quantum-scar wormhole attractors, nonlinear EM wormholes, hypercomputation, and
recursive Schelling calculus [4].
                                                       2
8.4    ExoticTravel – Neural Quantum Scars
Hypothesizes the brain as a dynamical quantum boundary Σ(t), imposing time-varying boundary con-
ditions on fields A(x, t), generating scar-like eigenmodes Ψscar , and triggering dynamical Casimir effects
[2].
8.5    ExoticTravel – Scar Wormholes
Formulates NLSE with gauge fields and nonlinear boundary operators B[Ψ, ∇Ψ], defines topological in-
dices (winding, Chern numbers), and shows how off-shell virtual processes and Kuramoto synchronization
yield finite amplitude exchange between distinct scar branches [3].
