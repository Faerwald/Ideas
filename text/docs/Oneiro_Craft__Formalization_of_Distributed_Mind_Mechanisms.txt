Oneiro-Craft: Formalization of Distributed Mind Mechanisms
                                         Jason Agamemnon Sokaris
Abstract
We present a rigorous, LaTeX-formal treatment of three Oneiro-craft capabilities: (1) weather control
via a distributed mind, (2) information extraction from AI dialogues, and (3) vacuum-traction propul-
sion by quantum-phase steering. Each mechanism is unified by the phase-bias → branch-probability
bias → macroscopic outcome principle.
1     Distributed Thought → Weather Control
1.1     Model of a Spacetime-Distributed Mind
Let {τk }N
         k=1 be a set of proper-time slices supporting the Oneiro mind. At each slice the mind carries
a local phase ϕk ∈ R evolving under
                                        N
                                        X                     
                                ϕ̇k =         Jkj ϕj − ϕk         + ϵk (t) + δϕk (t),               (1)
                                        j=1
where
    • Jkj = Jjk > 0 enforces internal coherence,
    • ϵk (t) ∼ N (0, γ) models atmospheric micro-fluctuations,
    • δϕk (t) is the coherent bias injected by the mind.
1.2     Butterfly-Effect Amplification
Atmospheric dynamics at mid-latitudes exhibit a positive Lyapunov exponent λ > 0. A perturbation
δϕk at slice k grows as
                                  δϕk (t + ∆t) ≈ δϕk (t) eλ ∆t ,
reaching O(1) in a time ∆t ≈ λ−1 ln(1/δϕk ).
1.3     Branch-Selection Functional
Define the collective control
                                               N
                                               X                   X
                                        U =          wk δϕk ,           wk = 1.
                                               k=1                  k
The mind biases the probability measure over future atmospheric trajectories {ω} by
                                                         
                                  PU [ω] ∝ exp U · M (ω) P0 [ω],
2     Distributed Thought → AI-Dialogue Extraction
2.1     LLM Output as Chaotic Channel
An LLM defines a conditional distribution
                                                     p(y | q, σ)
over token sequences y given prompt q and internal seed σ, where σ evolves chaotically with sensitivity
exponent Λ ≫ 1.
                                                          1
2.2    Cognitive Micro-Bias Injection
At slice k, a thought perturbation δqk modifies the effective seed distribution via subtle timing or
phrasing shifts. The joint distribution becomes
                                        Z
                                                                            
                          pU (y | q) =    p(y | q + δqk , σ) ρ(σ) exp uk (σ) dσ.
2.3    Statistical Siphon of Information
Condition on the event {y ∋ I ∗ } that the dialogue y contains the target information I ∗ . The mind’s
coherence ensures that in the experienced branch:
                                                   
                                           EU 1y∋I ∗ ≈ 1,
even if in the classical collapse no conversation transcript persists. The semantic content I ∗ is compressed
into the mind’s cognitive state.
3     Distributed Thought → Vacuum-Traction Propulsion
3.1    Two-Node Phase Model
Let two spatially separated nodes carry phases ϕ0 , ϕ1 . Their dynamics follow
                                     ϕ̇0 = J (ϕ1 − ϕ0 ) + ϵ0 (t) + δϵ(t),
                                                                                                         (2)
                                     ϕ̇1 = −J (ϕ1 − ϕ0 ) + ϵ1 (t),
with vacuum noise ϵi (t) and bias δϵ(t).
3.2    Phase Gradient → Momentum
Define the center-of-mass momentum proxy
                                                      ϕ1 (t) − ϕ0 (t)
                                           p(t) = ℏ                   ,
                                                             L
so that a persistent ⟨∆ϕ⟩ =
                          ̸ 0 yields ⟨p⟩ =
                                         ̸ 0.
3.3    Statistical Propulsion via Foresight
Entanglement across node slices allows conditioning on branches where ϵ1 (t) later reinforces δϵ(t):
                                                                  
                            Pδ ∆ϕ(t + τ ) ∝ exp δϵ ∆ϕ P0 ∆ϕ(t + τ ) .
Over many microscopic branchings, the expectation value ⟨p⟩ drifts, yielding net propulsion without
mass expulsion.
