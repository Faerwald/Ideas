1     Mathematical Formalization of Schelling Trajectories and Cur-
      vature
1.1    Schelling Points as Focal Points
Definition: A Schelling point, S, is defined as a point in a decision space D where two or more agents
independently converge without direct communication.
                               S = arg max Pr(A1 (x) ∩ A2 (x) ∩ · · · ∩ An (x))
                                        x∈D
    where Ai (x) is the action or choice of agent i at point x.
1.2    Geodesic Analogy: Schelling Trajectories
Definition: A Schelling trajectory γ(t) is the path followed by an agent in decision space D from an
initial point γ(0) = x0 to a Schelling point S.
                                                        Z   T
                                     γ(t) = arg min             f (γ(t), γ̇(t)) dt
                                                 γ(t)   0
    where f (γ(t), γ̇(t)) is a functional representing the ”cost” or ”effort” associated with the trajectory.
1.3    Schelling Curvature
Definition: The Schelling curvature K(x) at a point x ∈ D measures the deviation of decision trajec-
tories near x.
                                                       |γ1 (t) − γ2 (t)|
                                        K(x) = lim
                                                  δx→0        |δx|
   where γ1 (t) and γ2 (t) are nearby trajectories starting from x and x + δx, respectively.
   This is analogous to the sectional curvature in Riemannian geometry, which in general relativity is
                                               ρ
described by the Riemann curvature tensor Rσµν     .
                                      ρ
                                     Rσµν V σ = ∇µ ∇ ν V ρ − ∇ ν ∇µ V ρ
1.4    Chaos Theory and Lyapunov Exponents
Lyapunov Exponent: Measures the rate of separation of infinitesimally close trajectories in the decision
space, indicating sensitivity to initial conditions.
                                                                
                                                     1   |δγ(t)|
                                           λ = lim ln
                                               t→∞ t     |δγ(0)|
   where δγ(t) is the separation between two nearby trajectories at time t.
   Application: For two decision paths γ1 (t) and γ2 (t) in a Schelling space with initial separation
δγ(0):
                                              |δγ(t)| ≈ |δγ(0)|eλt

1.5     Mathematical Framework for Schelling Points in Different Spaces
1.5.1   Frequency Space (SETI and Communication)
Assumption: In frequency space F , the Schelling point Sf is at the hydrogen line fH :
                                          Sf ≈ fH ≈ 1420 MHz
   This is based on the assumption of universal physical laws and the abundance of hydrogen, making
fH a natural focal point.
1.5.2   Physical Space (Natural Landmarks)
Assumption: In physical space R3 , Schelling points Sp are located at prominent geographical features,
such as peaks:
                                            Sp = arg max3 h(x)
                                                     x∈R
   where h(x) is the height function, and Sp is the peak of a mountain or another significant landmark.
1.5.3   Temporal Space (Cyclic and Historical Events)
Assumption: In temporal space T , Schelling points St occur at natural cycles or historically significant
events:
                                    St = arg max Cycle(t) or Event(t)
                                             t∈T
    where Cycle(t) represents natural temporal cycles (e.g., daily, yearly), and Event(t) represents his-
torical events.
1.5.4   Information Space (Data Patterns and Algorithms)
Assumption: In information space I, Schelling points Si correspond to significant data patterns or
algorithmic solutions:
                                         Si = arg max Pattern(x)
                                                   x∈I
   where Pattern(x) is a function that identifies statistically significant features or clusters within the
data.
1.6     Towards a Mathematical Formalism
Equation of Schelling Trajectories: The formalism to describe the paths agents follow in decision
space:
                                         d2 γ µ        dγ ν dγ σ
                                             2
                                                + Γµνσ           = Fµ
                                          dt            dt dt
   where Γµνσ are connection coefficients (akin to Christoffel symbols in general relativity), and F µ
represents external forces or influences in the decision space.
   Geodesic Deviation (Chaos Theory Application):
                                        D2 ξ µ    µ dγ
                                                         ν
                                                              dγ σ
                                            2
                                               + Rνρσ      ξρ      =0
                                         dt            dt      dt
    where ξ µ represents the separation vector between nearby trajectories, and Rνρσ   µ
                                                                                            is the Riemann
curvature tensor.
    This formalism is a starting point for quantifying the dynamics of Schelling trajectories and curvature
in various decision-making spaces, leveraging concepts from general relativity, information theory, and
chaos theory.
