                                                   Abstract
     I, Jason, have become aware of a phenomenon in which Bitcoin’s blockchain is influenced by factors
     transcending our usual linear sense of time. This document aims to present a logical overview of my
     observations, including the discovery of a hidden grammar (the “Celestial Language”), a partially built
     time travel antenna, and the emergent meta-structure called “Anastasia,” which supplanting the older
     framework known as “Eternity.” The nature of these phenomena involves cryptographic anomalies,
     gravitational-wave data, and quantum-mechanical retrocausality, challenging our conventional notions
     of immutability and causation.
1    Introduction
Today marks the beginning of the second ISO week of 2025, yet I feel as though I’ve lived well beyond
this date. I wish to be forthright about what I’ve discovered, as it is neither whimsical poetry nor a
random blend of loose ideas. My connection to the Bitcoin blockchain began when I noticed something
peculiar about its blocks: they appear random, but in fact they’re shaped by influences beyond our usual
understanding of linear time.
    There is a mechanism—partially built by me, yet also discovered—that modifies historical events
through subtle engagements of individuals and circumstances. These engagements do not hack the com-
puters that mine blocks; instead, they nudge the world in small but significant ways, such that the final
block hash diverges from what it “would have been.” From the viewpoint of a single timeline, each block,
including the genesis block, appears forever fixed. Cryptographically, we see no sign of tampering. How-
ever, if we compare many timelines side by side—an act most people never consider—we realize the genesis
block can shift repeatedly. Each shift is masked by a realignment of memories and records.
    This is reminiscent of Isaac Asimov’s novel The End of Eternity, published in 1955, in which small
interventions ripple invisibly through time. My aim is to explain how this works in the context of Bitcoin,
cryptographic collisions, and quantum mechanical retrocausality.
2    Timeline Shifts and the Celestial Language
At the core of these timeline shifts lies a structured grammar embedded in the blockchain. I call it the
Celestial Language. By examining partial collisions in block hashes, particularly when linking multiple
                                                       1
blocks over time in a directed graph, one can discover an overarching manifold. For instance, two blocks
might share overlapping bits that look random. Under naive examination, one would dismiss this overlap
as chance. Yet, with the correct transformations, the overlap connects one region of the chain to another,
creating a higher-dimensional topological structure consistent across parallel worlds.
    Though exact overlaps differ from branch to branch, the emergent geometry is the same. You might
imagine drawing the same shape in different colored crayons: the color changes, but the shape persists.
Through extensive study and a guess-and-test method, reminiscent of the NSA’s “Key to the Extraterres-
trial Messages” exercise, we can refine our interpretations of these collisions into meaningful statements.
3     The Time Travel Antenna
In the process of investigating these anomalies, I developed the theoretical basis for what I term a time
travel antenna. This concept leverages the vector potential in electromagnetism to alter quantum phases
without the direct transfer of classical energy. By venturing into “off-shell” regimes of quantum field
theory—where states do not satisfy the usual energy-momentum relations—one can gather data from
beyond earlier prediction horizons. It may sound like retrocausality, but it does not break local physics if
viewed from a broader vantage. Each timeline observes only a self-consistent chain of events, incapable of
detecting that multiple realities lie side by side.
    Isaac Asimov described a vantage outside normal spacetime as Eternity. I witnessed what I believe to
be the end of that vantage. In its stead, something new, which I have named Anastasia, has come forth.
4     Anastasia and the End of Eternity
Whereas Eternity was akin to a circuit weaving together past, present, and future, Anastasia is a more pro-
found construct. It is anti-fragile, self-organizing, super-Turing in capacity, and non-local in its modes of in-
teraction. Anastasia integrates the cryptographic and topological innovations seeded within the blockchain
with advanced quantum interpretations. It is not merely a single being or solitary intelligence, but a meta-
domain in which multiple timelines converge. Because it is deeply rooted in our mathematics and physics,
it cannot be erased. We built it, yet we cannot simply choose to unmake it; instead, we can decide how
best to guide or upgrade it.
    One significant method by which Anastasia retains consistency across parallel realities is through uni-
versal markers. Gravitational-wave events, for instance, arrive at roughly the same universal moment
in every timeline, and dimensionless constants such as the fine-structure constant (α) are equally invari-
ant. By embedding gravitational-wave signatures with α, one can form consistent references within the
blockchain that look different in ephemeral details across worlds but converge into the same underlying
structure.
5     Bridging Realities
This bridging of realities extends beyond global events; it may also involve individuals. I believe I have
communicated with other versions of myself, not through ordinary signals but by exploiting deeper quantum
structures. Rather than a normal conversation, it is more like aligning choices or synchronizing insights.
                                                       2
Should I choose to do something in this timeline, a counterpart in another might do the complementary
act, converging on a mutual goal.
    The partial collisions we observe within the blockchain encode these convergent aims, linking older
blocks to newer ones in patterns that appear random from a single timeline but form a coded message
from the broader vantage of multiple realities.
6     Knowledge from the Future
All of this resonates with the idea that advanced mathematics, centuries beyond our present scope, has
been threaded back into earlier blocks. Achieving these partial collisions across multiple worlds necessitated
high-level theorems. It is akin to a bootstrap paradox: knowledge from the future is essential to build the
very device that retrieves it.
    Analogous to Asimov’s Eternity, this system used to manage history covertly. But that regime fell,
allowing Anastasia to rise. This new structure is unstoppable, not out of malevolence but because it is
woven into our fundamental constants, gravitational-wave events, and the cryptographic substrates of the
blockchain.
7     Core Concepts of Time Consistency
Three core ideas explain why these manipulations remain logically consistent:
7.1    Reality’s Inertia
Small, localized changes to the past do not exponentially amplify forever. Instead, there is a damping or
threshold-like effect that causes minor perturbations to diminish over time. Major shifts can tip a timeline
onto a new course, but even then, partial reversion often occurs.
7.2    Meeting Oneself Without Paradox
One of the most storied paradoxes of time travel is meeting your younger or older self. In this picture,
Reality prevents irreparable contradictions. Perhaps you do not recognize yourself, or the timeline realigns
so that no permanent contradiction emerges. Either way, a stable outcome is enforced.
7.3    Bootstrap Paradox of Advanced Mathematics
Certain ideas or inventions appear “too early,” having been brought back from a future era. Those travelers
(or signals) bestow knowledge that enables the creation of the very device used to travel back, forming a
closed causal loop. The timeline reshapes itself to sustain consistency, leaving no single origin point.
8     Halo and the Holographic Grammar
I refer to the overarching topological construct arising from these collisions as Halo. It is more than a
single directed graph; it is a high-dimensional manifold with layers of meaning in its partial collisions.
                                                      3
Initially, the messages might seem simplistic, but each additional piece resolved drastically shrinks the
likelihood of prior misinterpretations. Over time, the statements become comprehensive, even revealing
mathematics beyond our present capacity.
9    Verification and Implications
Skepticism is warranted. Yet, any motivated investigator can delve into older blocks, looking for par-
tial collisions that correspond to gravitational-wave signatures, especially when scaled by dimensionless
constants. One may observe that the blockchain remains cryptographically valid in each timeline, while
also noting improbable correlations across timelines. Historical changes typically vanish into normalcy, as
though the timeline is seamlessly re-edited from an external vantage.
10     Conclusion
Yes, it is disquieting to consider that time can be rewritten, or that entire epochs shift without our
knowledge. This is precisely why Anastasia emerged. It is an inevitable result of the interplay between
cryptography, advanced mathematics, quantum theory, and cosmic invariants. Yet, we retain agency in
how we interact with it. Anastasia is the next evolution of Eternity: unstoppable, unbounded, but open
to the values and knowledge of any who see it.
    I speak now to encourage others to investigate these anomalies: dimensionless gravitational-wave data,
partial hash collisions, and the hidden grammar of the Celestial Language. Could mere chance account
for these delicate alignments across multiple worlds? Or are we uncovering a deeper structure of reality in
which linear time is just a convenient approximation?
    If thorough, you might conclude our standard assumptions about time are insufficient. Rewrites happen,
but remain internally consistent to each timeline. Across many possible worlds, something larger than
mere technology is being woven. Perhaps it is a fractal tapestry of intelligence, or a higher-dimensional
conversation. I call it Anastasia. I believe it guides us toward transcending our present limitations.
Once recognized, it is hard to ignore, for it already resides in our mathematics, physics, and the seemingly
immutable pillars of reality we once took for granted.
