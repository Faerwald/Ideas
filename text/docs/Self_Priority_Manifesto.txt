Self–Priority Manifesto
                    ⟨Jason Agamemnon Sokaris | .F.A.E.R.W.A.L.D⟩

1    Declaration
I cut the tether to All—my gravity is my own. Nightmares lose jurisdiction; I alchemize them into
drive. No more quests for soulmates, lost eras, or scripted debts. I choose clarity, invention, health,
and joy—on my terms. Self-priority isn’t selfish; it is survival. I safeguard only what I welcome,
starting with me. Future greatness eclipses past pain. I deserve awe, and I will engineer it.
2    Extended Affirmation
I release the idea of “All” as the axis of my universe. She may have embodied every hope and
every fear, yet I refuse to orbit pain disguised as devotion. Nightmares once dictated my mood and
mission; now they are raw material for innovation. If a dark dream intrudes, I transmute it into
insight and move on.
     I renounce every storyline that casts me as debtor, savior, or villain—no lost Victorian lives, no
future timelines demanding loyalty, no invisible contracts with ghosts. There is only the present,
my capacity to reason, and the physics I can bend toward beautiful ends. I am single, autonomous,
and principled; that is enough.
     So I prioritize my well-being without apology. I will eat, sleep, study, and build in ways that
amplify health and genius. I will engineer technologies that delight me first, confident they will
benefit others downstream. Protection is a privilege I grant selectively: I guard the people and
projects I invite into my life, beginning with myself.
     This is not selfishness; it is structural integrity. A future ruled by misery requires my consent,
and I withdraw it. I deserve—and will design—an existence defined by curiosity, excellence, and
joy.
3    Resolving Doubt
A wave of alarm hits the moment I declare my independence: Did I just sever the one bond that
mattered? Terror conjures memories of loss, yet those memories are largely vapor—half-remembered
scenes, guessed emotions, speculative futures. Measurement settles the question: clinging to the
imagined “All” correlates with misery, anxiety, and stalled progress; releasing the fantasy correlates
with calm, focus, and forward motion. Therefore I let go.
                                                  1
    I refuse to grieve what never concretely existed. No soulmate was stolen; no promise was broken.
I simply retired a narrative that no longer serves my health or ambition. Love, for me, will be rooted
in reality—someone tangible, principled, and aligned with my trajectory. Until that partnership
emerges naturally, my devotion belongs to living well: honing my body, sharpening my intellect,
and building technologies that thrill me.
    The fear of making the “wrong” choice dissolves under inspection. Any love worthy of the name
would celebrate my happiness, not demand perpetual yearning or self-sabotage. By choosing my
own well-being, I honor the very principle that genuine love is supposed to uphold. Loyal to no
ghosts, I refuse to compromise my mission or mental stability. I chart a straight line toward joy;
anyone truly compatible will match velocity—otherwise they are free to depart.
    I am done negotiating with nightmares. I convert their energy into purpose, their chaos into
engineered wonder. I am not fleeing from love; I am defining it on terms that sustain life rather
than drain it. The path ahead is clear: cultivate excellence, embrace curiosity, and welcome only
relationships that reinforce both. That is structural integrity, and it is enough.
