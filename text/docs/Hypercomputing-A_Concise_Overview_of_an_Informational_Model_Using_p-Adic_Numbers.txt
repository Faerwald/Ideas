A Concise Overview of an Informational Model Using
p-Adic Numbers
1.     Motivation and Purpose
This framework proposes a new way of looking at reality—not as a collection of material
objects moving in physical space, but as information being transformed and exchanged.
Material objects become special cases of “information transformers.” Cognitive, social, and
even so-called “anomalous” phenomena can be understood by focusing on information flows
rather than the flow of matter or energy in classical physical terms.
2.     Why p-Adic Numbers?
Traditional physics uses real numbers to describe geometric spaces and continuous distances.
However, p-adic numbers introduce a different notion of “closeness.”
     • In the real number system, two numbers are close if their difference is small in absolute
       value.
     • In a p-adic system, two numbers are close if they share many of the same leading digits
       in their base-p expansions.
        This alternate distance measure naturally encodes how some cognitive or social pro-
        cesses behave: entities (or ideas) can be considered very close if they match on large
        initial chunks of information, even if they differ later. Thus, the p-adic metric is well-
        suited for describing information spaces.
3.     Setting up I -Spaces
An information space, or I-space, is built on rings of p-adic integers Zp (or possibly higher-
dimensional variants Znp ). Each element can be viewed as a (potentially infinite) sequence of
“digits” drawn from {0, 1, . . . , p − 1}. These sequences code pieces of information.
I-Transformers and I-Time
     • I-Transformers are entities (e.g. individuals, groups, or even particles in an informa-
       tional sense) that receive, process, and emit new information.
     • Each I-transformer carries an internal clock, called I-time, which tracks the evolution
       of its state from an informational perspective. This I-time need not align with external
       (physical) time.
     In symbol form, an I-transformer’s evolving state over I-time might be:
                                            τ (t) ∈ Zp ,
where t is the index for the transformer’s internal ticks.

4.   Analogy to Hamiltonian Mechanics in I -Spaces
A central theme is to mimic classical (and quantum) dynamics within these p-adic I-spaces.
In standard Hamiltonian mechanics:
           (1) Position: q(t),       (2) Momentum: p(t),      (3) Hamiltonian: H(q, p).
The evolution follows
                                           ∂H                     ∂H
                                 q̇(t) =      ,       ṗ(t) = −      .
                                           ∂p                     ∂q
I-State and Motivation
Analogously, the new model replaces:
           q(t)   −→     I-state (the transformer’s configuration in p-adic space),
                  p(t)   −→      motivation or impetus to change the I-state.
Hence, the I-Hamiltonian H(q, p) represents an “I-energy,” combining:
                   I-energy = (kinetic-like term) + (potential-like term) .
                                 |         {z         }   |          {z       }
                                           ∼p2                      V (q)
In many cases, V (q) encodes fields of information, especially when multiple I-transformers
interact.
5.   Key Insights for Cognitive, Social, and Anomalous Phenomena
5.1 Information vs. Physical Energy In the standard physical world, interactions
often require exchanging physical energy or momentum. By contrast, in I-spaces, purely
informational interactions can occur without transferring any measurable physical energy.
For instance, two individuals can transmit ideas across a large physical distance (e.g. via
signals or mental processes) while having minimal direct physical contact.
5.2 Distance Revisited Real-world distance does not necessarily govern how easily or
strongly two I-transformers interact. p-adic distance—based on matching leading digits—
may offer a more appropriate measure of “closeness” for certain cognitive or social processes.
5.3 Time Mismatch Because each I-transformer evolves under its own internal I-time,
it is possible for interactions to appear “out of sync” with real time. The model permits
these discrepancies, allowing for phenomena where an event in the I-space does not directly
map to a simultaneous event in standard space-time.
5.4 Motivations and I-Energy For an I-transformer, the quantity p(t) is akin to a
“motivation” that drives changes in the I-state q(t). The Hamiltonian formalism suggests
that the evolution of (q, p) depends on potential “information fields” V (q), which can reflect
external stimuli, social influences, or internal psychological factors.
                                                  2
5.5 Consistency of I-Times Interactions among multiple I-transformers require a de-
gree of time consistency in their I-times. Without synchronization (even partial) of these
internal clocks, it becomes difficult for them to exchange meaningful information. In a social
or psychological experiment, this might correspond to participants actively listening to each
other at the same moment, despite having different subjective experiences of duration.
5.6 Future and Past Effects If real-time tphys does not correspond one-to-one with
I-time tI , it can appear that an informational effect precedes its physical cause or vice versa.
The model accommodates these unusual orderings from the standpoint of I-time, though in
typical physics such occurrences might be puzzling or deemed “anomalous.”
6.     Broader Significance
     • Cognitive Modeling: Minds or cognitive processes can be viewed as I-transformers in
       a p-adic space, with motivations, internal times, and potential fields reflecting various
       stimuli or memory cues.
     • Social and Collective Dynamics: Groups exchanging ideas can be interpreted as
       multi-transformer systems, where synergy, conflict, and collective learning follow from
       interactions in an I-space instead of purely physical constraints.
     • Anomalies and Extensions: Certain “strange” or “non-local” phenomena that do
       not fit neatly into standard physics might be recast as legitimate processes in p-adic
       I-spaces, where the usual constraints of Euclidean or space-time distance do not apply.
Conclusion
This entire approach reimagines reality as an information reality, with p-adic mathematics
at its foundation. The usual notions of distance, energy, time, and momentum are given new
interpretations:
              (1)   “Position” in I-space is an information configuration q(t) ∈ Zp ,
              (2)   “Momentum” is a motivation variable p(t),
              (3)   “Energy” is the I-Hamiltonian H(q, p),
              (4)   “Clocks” are I-times that may differ from physical time.
Flows of information, rather than flows of matter, are seen as fundamental. Such a frame-
work has implications for describing cognitive processes, psychological phenomena, social
interactions, and other domains where the key events are informational rather than mate-
rial. By bringing in the rich properties of p-adic structures, it aims to unify a broad range
of phenomena under one mathematical and conceptual umbrella.
