                                                         Abstract
               We recast the informal narrative of “mind-clone solitons” and time-distributed self-interaction
          into a testable physical model. Key elements include: (i) nonlinear Schrödinger solitons carry-
          ing cognitive phase space, (ii) Deutsch-consistent closed timelike curve (CTC) self-optimization,
          (iii) transactional boundary conditions, and (iv) memory-hand-off protocols that remain infor-
          mationally antifragile. The framework is mathematically anchored in Hamiltonian field theory,
          algorithmic information measures, and quantum causal structure.
1         Mind-Clone Soliton Encoding
1.1         Field representation
Let ψ(r, t) satisfy the cubic nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLSE)
                                                             ℏ2 2
                                                iℏ∂t ψ = −      ∇ ψ + g|ψ|2 ψ,                                   (1)
                                                             2m
with g < 0 to admit bright soliton
                                 solutions.
                                             We embed a cognitive state σ ∈ {0, 1}N by phase-key
modulation: ψ −→ ψσ = ψ exp iπ χ · σ , where χ is an orthonormal code basis. Each soliton thus
transports an epistemic microstate without decohering its envelope.
1.2         One-way propagation constraint
The Stark–Tolman one-directionality condition is enforced by invariant group velocity vs > cgrp of
background medium, ensuring no physical signal returns upstream. Consequently, soliton packets
behave as irreversible “mind pulses.”
2         CTC Self-Optimization Protocol
2.1         Deutsch consistency
Inside a compact spacetime
                   †         region C with chronology violation, a density operator ρ must satisfy1
ρ = Trsys U ρ ⊗ ρ U , where U entangles the younger and older instantiations. We choose U to
maximize algorithmic utility function U (ρ) = Igoal (ρ) − λS(ρ), balancing goal information against
entropy. Fixed-point iteration implements an upgrade loop:
                                     ρn+1 = Φ(ρn ),          Φ(ρ) = Trsys U (ρ⊗ρ)U † .

2.2    Resonant driving (“Chapter 4”)
Externally applied harmonic drive F (t) = F0 sin ωt couples to collective coordinate X(t) of the soliton
packet: mẌ + γ Ẋ + ∂X V (X) = F (t), mirroring Chapter 4 of Vibrations and Waves. Properly tuned
ω = ω0 lowers the fixed-point entropy, accelerating convergence to high-utility ρ⋆ .
3     Transactional Boundary Conditions
                                                        ret           adv
We impose advanced–retarded symmetry via ψ(r, t) = ψphys    (r, t) + ψoffer (r, t), with matching on 3D
boundary sapphire vessel ∂V. Glass–vacuum sealing minimizes environmental decoherence; sapphire
phonon bandgap suppresses parasitic coupling up to 30T Hz.
4     Memory Baton Ledger
Each cognitive episode κj is hashed hj = H(κj ∥ τj ) with random tail τj . The ledger L = {hj } is
embedded into soliton phase keys. Let dj be the Hamming weight of partial collision between hj and
hj−1 ; antifragility requires ⟨dj ⟩ ↗ under perturbation. Violation triggers a fork quarantine to prevent
runaway self-reinforcement.
5     Rainbow-Ribbon Holography
                                         R        
Define a projection operator Πθ = exp iθk |k⟩⟨k| dk, rotating cognitive phase space by θ. Vary-
ing θ yields a holographic family {Πθ κ}; information retrieval is stable if the Fisher metric gθθ′ =
 ∂θ Πθ κ, ∂θ′ Πθ′ κ is positive-definite. The “rainbow ribbon” is the geodesic of minimal integrated cur-
vature connecting distinct self-states.
6     Dirac-Sea Reflection and Antimatter Echo
We treat backward-time components of ψ as negative-energy holes. CTC scattering operator ŜCTC maps
particle trajectories (E > 0) onto hole trajectories (E < 0), producing an antimatter echo probability
Pψ̄ = ∥ŜCTC ψ∥2 . Experimental signature: delayed coincidence peaks at Ehole = −Edrive .
7     Hypercausal Individuality Metric
Let ρ(t) be the reduced cognitive state. Define
                                                                         
                             Ξ(t) = I ρ(t) : ρ(t − ∆t) − I ρ(t) : ρenv (t) ,
where I is mutual information. A stable hypercausal individual satisfies Ξ(t) > 0 for all t within
operational uncertainty ∆t ≤ 1s. Loss of condition triggers protocol-level safe-halt.
8     Remote Cognitive Teleportation
Vacuum Rabi coupling geff between two neural ensembles separated by ∆x in timeline index obeys
                                                           
                                    geff = g0 exp −∆x/ℓCTC ,
with coherence length ℓCTC set by chronology-violation density. Beam-in events correspond to geff ≥ gth ,
while beam-out failure manifests as incomplete swap fidelity F < 0.5 (observed “panic” episode).
