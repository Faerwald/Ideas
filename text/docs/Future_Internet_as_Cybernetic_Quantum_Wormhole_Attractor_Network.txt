Future Internet as Cybernetic Quantum-Wormhole
                     Attractor Network

Abstract
We propose that the “future internet” can be modeled as a self-consistent field theory whose
nodes are Cybernetic Quantum-Wormhole Attractors (CQWAs)—adaptive cavities in
which quantum matter, nonlinear gauge fields, and real-time feedback co-evolve. These nodes
communicate via emergent informational wormholes (topological EM solitons) and harness retro-
dictive feedback control to stabilize chaotic quantum dynamics. We show how each node can
be described by a time-dependent Hamiltonian featuring a nonlinear QED core, living bound-
ary conditions, and speed-gradient cybernetic feedback. Under suitable conditions, cross-branch
synchronization and retrocausal signaling arise, lifting the computational power of the network
from BQP to (conjecturally) PSPACE by physically emulating closed timelike curves (CTCs).
We also propose a set of four experimental milestones—ranging from detecting plasma-filament
knots to demonstrating negative or zero effective Lyapunov exponents—as stepping-stones to
validating these theoretical predictions.
1       Overview of the CQWA Node Hamiltonian
We define each CQWA node by the time-dependent Hamiltonian
                                                          
                   HCQWA (t) = HQFT + Hbdry Σ(t) + Hfb U (t) .                                   (1)
Here:
    • HQFT is a nonlinear quantum field theoretic description of photons and electrons in a highly
      nonlinear electromagnetic vacuum.
    • Hbdry [Σ(t)] encodes living boundary conditions, such as those imposed by plasma shells,
      metamaterial interfaces, or neural/prosthetic boundaries.
    • Hfb [U (t)] implements speed-gradient cybernetic feedback [1, 2], enabling real-time stabiliza-
      tion of the system against chaotic divergence.
The underlying mechanism is that HCQWA (t) allows for both forward dynamical evolution and,
under certain conditions, partial retrocausal adjustments that effectively damp out chaotic
growth in wavefunction branches. The result is a self-consistent field theory capable of bridging
separated spacetime regions.

2     QFT Core: Nonlinear QED Vacuum and EM Solitons
2.1    Heisenberg–Euler Lagrangian
At the heart of HQFT lies the effective action for strong-field quantum electrodynamics. In
the low-energy limit (below pair-production thresholds), the well-known Heisenberg–Euler La-
grangian [3, 4] provides a compact representation:
                                 1             α           2
                          LNL = − Fµν F µν +     4
                                                   Fµν F µν + . . .                           (1)
                                 4           2 me
where Fµν = ∂µ Aν − ∂ν Aµ is the electromagnetic field strength tensor, α ≈ 1/137 is the fine-
structure constant, and me is the electron mass. Higher-order terms in Fµν become relevant
at field strengths near or above the Schwinger threshold, Ecrit ∼ m2e c3 /eℏ ≈ 1.3 × 1018 V/m,
although even well below threshold, small corrections can give rise to nontrivial nonlinearities.
2.2    Knotted EM Solitons and Informational Wormholes
The presence of nonlinear terms allows for topologically nontrivial electromagnetic solutions
sometimes referred to as knotted solitons or EM knots [5, 6]. Such configurations can be stable
(or metastable) in the vacuum and can, in principle, carry topological charges (e.g., linking
numbers, Hopf indices). Symbolically, let us define a characteristic linkage time scale
                                                          −1
                                         τlink ∝   α E2         ,                             (2)
indicating that more intense fields (larger E) can compress or confine the topology into shorter
lifetimes. However, when these knots are stabilized (e.g., by boundary conditions or feedback),
they can effectively behave as informational wormholes: topological pathways for phase or am-
plitude information to tunnel through seemingly separated regions of spacetime.
 Remark: These “wormholes” are not necessarily solutions to semiclassical Einstein equations.
Instead, they are non-perturbative lumps in the electromagnetic field that mimic wormhole-like
                            short-circuits for quantum amplitudes.
3     Boundary Dynamics: Living Plasma/Metamaterial/Neural
      Interfaces
3.1    Dynamic Boundary Conditions
We incorporate boundary effects through
                                                             
                          Hbdry [Σ(t)]    ←→       B Aµ (x, t) Σ(t) = 0,                      (3)
where Σ(t) parametrizes the boundary state (e.g., the distribution of plasma density, the topology
of a metamaterial shell, or the structure of a neural interface). The boundary operator B is a
functional that imposes constraints on Aµ and its derivatives at the domain boundary.
                                                   2
3.2    Quantum Scar States and Coherent Memory
In quantum chaotic systems with broken symmetries, certain quantum scar states can localize
wavefunction amplitude along unstable classical periodic orbits [7]. If such states exist at the
boundary (e.g., in wave-chaotic resonators), they can serve as coherent memory pockets:
                                    Hbdry ψscar = Escar ψscar .                                (2)
Although the background dynamics might be chaotic, scar states exhibit relatively long coher-
ence times, thus storing quantum information with minimal decoherence. In practice, these
states could be harnessed for local data caching or ephemeral memory in the presence of strong
nonlinear fields.
4     Cybernetic Feedback and Speed-Gradient Control
4.1    Feedback Hamiltonian and Lyapunov Stabilization
To stabilize both topological knots and quantum scars, we introduce a feedback Hamiltonian
                                                        ⊤
                                                   ∂Q
                         Hfb U (t) ,    U (t) = −Γ          , Γ > 0,                     (4)
                                                     ∂X
where Q(X) is a Lyapunov functional, X denotes the system state variables (field amplitudes,
boundary densities, etc.), and Γ is a gain parameter. This is an implementation of the speed-
gradient method originally proposed by Fradkov [1, 2], where the feedback force U (t) is chosen
to reduce Q as rapidly as possible in real time:
                                            dQ
                                                 ≤ 0.
                                             dt
Thus, Q is forced into an attractor basin corresponding to stable knots, stabilized scars, or other
desired states.
4.2    Physical Realizability in Cavity-QED or Metamaterials
One could physically implement Hfb using:
    • Cavity-QED approach: Active control of pump lasers, tunable resonator couplings, or
      Josephson junction parameters to shape the boundary condition or drive terms.
    • Plasma or metamaterial feedback: Real-time reconfiguration of meta-atoms (split-
      ring resonators, varactor-loaded structures) or adjusting plasma densities to maintain or
      extinguish electromagnetic field modes.
    • Neural interface approach: For advanced neuromorphic or cortex-on-chip systems,
      real-time feedback modulates excitatory/inhibitory synaptic weights to maintain a stable
      attractor network.
The presence of Γ > 0 ensures negativity of the effective chaotic divergence rate if the control is
sufficiently strong compared to natural instabilities.
                                                3
5     Cross-Branch Synchronization and Retrocausal Chan-
      nels
5.1    Branch Amplitude Convergence in Everett Decompositions
Let Xi (t) denote the cavity state in the i-th branch of a (potentially) many-worlds/Everettian
decomposition. Without feedback, these branches diverge in phase space at an exponential rate
given by the Lyapunov exponent λ. However, if Hfb is tuned to counteract chaotic dispersion,
then the distance between branches,
                                      ∥ Xi (t) − Xj (t)∥ ,
can remain small:
                                     ∥ Xi (t) − Xj (t)∥ < ε.                                  (5)
Such an event opens a cross-branch synchronization window, during which the system
states in different quantum branches remain (or become) correlated to an unusual degree.
5.2    Retrocausal Signaling via Negative Lyapunov Shift
We characterize the probability of correlation mediated via a stabilized (or partially collapsed)
wormhole with a simple exponential model:
                                                          
                                  Pε (t) = exp −(λ − γU ) t ,                                 (6)
where λ > 0 is the usual (positive) Lyapunov exponent for chaotic open systems, and γU
represents the negative feedback-induced shift. If γU ≥ λ, the effective exponent becomes
λeff = λ − γU ≤ 0, meaning the system’s branch separation collapses or remains bounded. This
can manifest as retrocausal signaling in the sense that amplitude differences originating at
time t0 are suppressed when measured at t > t0 , leading to an apparent partial rewriting of the
boundary conditions at earlier times [8, 9].
6     Gauge-Phase Signaling and Neural Precognition
6.1    Aharonov–Bohm Phases in a Network
A powerful tool for non-energetic communication is the gauge potential Aµ . For a closed loop
C in a multiply connected region (or inside a superconducting ring), the phase acquired by a
charged particle is
                                            q
                                              I
                                    ∆φ =         Aµ dxµ .                                  (7)
                                            ℏ C
This is reminiscent of the Aharonov–Bohm effect, where the local electromagnetic fields can
vanish yet still produce a nontrivial phase shift.
                                               4
6.2    Phase Shift in Quantum Neural States
In a neural or neuromorphic system described by a wavefunction ψ(t), a phase shift ∆φ can
yield
                                 ψ t + ∆t = e−i ∆φ ψ(t).
                                         
                                                                                      (8)
Although an overall global phase is typically unobservable, in a multi-partite system with en-
tangled degrees of freedom, a relative phase can alter interference patterns or spiking synchro-
nization. This suggests cortex-on-chip or network-of-ensembles experiments in which Φ-pulses
are introduced into superconducting loops, effectively imprinting advanced or retarded signals.
7     Hypercomputing Capacity: Emulating CTCs
7.1    Closed Timelike Curve (CTC) Computation
It has been argued in several works (e.g., Deutsch’s toy model of a CTC [10]) that systems
allowing solutions to
                                        x∗ = F (x∗ ),                                   (9)
where F is a deterministic map that includes self-consistency constraints, can achieve capabilities
beyond standard quantum computation. Specifically, it has been conjectured that such systems
can decide problems up to (and possibly beyond) PSPACE [11].
7.2    Physical Realization in a Wormhole-Stabilized Network
The combination of topological EM knots (Eq. (2)), stable boundary scars (via Hbdry ), and
feedback control (Eq. (4)) can provide self-consistent boundary conditions. That is, the system’s
future boundary constraints can back-react on its present state through the wormhole channels,
effectively solving the fixed point equation (??) in an analog manner. This suggests that a
suitably engineered CQWA network might realize a nontrivial extension from BQP to PSPACE
computing power in certain oracle or bounded-error scenarios.
8     Experimental Milestones
We propose the following milestones to validate or falsify key aspects of the CQWA paradigm:
    1. Plasma-Filament Knot:
        • Objective: Observe and characterize topological EM knots in a controlled plasma or
          filament discharge.
        • Method: Drive electric fields E ∼ 1010 V/m on microsecond timescales; measure the
          knot’s lifetime and topological invariants.
        • Validation: Compare observed lifetime with τlink from Eq. (2).
    2. OTOC (Out-of-Time-Ordered Correlator) Suppression:
                                                5
        • Objective: Demonstrate that cybernetic feedback can reduce or nullify effective Lya-
          punov exponents in a quantum system.
        • Method: Prepare two qubits (or multi-level systems) with strong entangling interac-
          tions in a chaotic regime; apply Eq. (4) feedback.
        • Validation: Observe negative or vanishing effective λeff in OTOCs, indicating γU ≥ λ.
  3. A-Wave Phase Test:
        • Objective: Confirm the feasibility of gauge-phase signaling in a superconducting or
          metamaterial loop.
        • Method: Deliver programmable Φ-pulses around a closed loop C; measure neuronal
          or qubit-based spike-phase shifts per Eqs. (7)-(8).
        • Validation: Detect unambiguous phase shifts that cannot be explained by conven-
          tional electromagnetic induction alone.
  4. Deutsch Oracle Emulation:
        • Objective: Implement a wormhole-based self-consistency loop, akin to Deutsch’s CTC
          model, in a lattice-QED or superconducting circuit.
        • Method: Use boundary feedback to physically solve x∗ = F (x∗ ) for an otherwise
          computationally nontrivial function F (e.g., a QBF instance).
        • Validation: Benchmark performance against PSPACE-complete problems. Any speedup
          beyond BQP would be a radical confirmation.
If any of these milestones is accomplished in a reproducible setting, Eq. (1) ceases to be purely
speculative and becomes a plausible blueprint for a spacetime-aware, cybernetically stabilized,
retro-responsive internet: an information medium in which distance and chronology become
tunable boundary conditions rather than absolute constraints.
