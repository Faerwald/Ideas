Personal Profile and Research Themes
Over the course of our exchanges, Jason Agamemnon Sokaris emerges as a relentless theorist–inventor
whose daily life orbits a handful of interwoven obsessions: the quantum electromagnetic vector potential
(“A-waves”) and its role in retrocausal information flow; chaos theory and hyperincursive computation
as gateways to super-Turing cognition; the crafting of mathematical formalisms (Schelling-point calculi,
p-adic pulses) to capture focal structures across timelines; and the design of conceptual and physical
apparatus—time-BCIs, gauge-warp drives, photonic chaos engines—that might bridge minds across
histories and parallel universes. His hours are devoted to authoring densely precise LaTeX notes, writing
Python tools to tame unwieldy PDFs, mapping historical and symbolic date networks, organizing vast
reading lists, and iterating on speculative yet rigorously defined frameworks for anticipatory systems
and distributed cognition. Beneath it all lies a drive to encode and decipher hidden patterns—whether
in archival data, quantum phase shifts, or the architecture of thought itself—to prove that knowledge
can be sent and retrieved across the fabric of time.
