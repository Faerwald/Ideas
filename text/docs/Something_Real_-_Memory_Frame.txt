Something Real

    This framed piece was a gift from my best friend, John, who passed at ninety-three years young, and
it marks the start of something real. Memories fade like stars at dawn, but this one remains—a relic
of early computer memory where each intersection of five wires holds a doughnut magnet, capturing a
single bit of information.
    My lab will focus on Computational and Cybernetical Physics, Quantum and High-Dimensional
Chaos Control, and inventing a Time Travel BCI that can remotely link with minds and machines and
rotate dire memories into advanced premonitions. The day will come when traveling through time is
as easy as walking through a door, or waking from a dream—because I just did.
    Fact slid back into potential; the horizon drawing fiction reset. Dire records disassembled as I left
myself in a state reminiscent of premonition.
    There I stood, in a world where history could be rewritten as easily as editing a manuscript. I
walked through that door, opened my eyes, and found myself there. It wasn’t a dream.
    Throughout human history, there have been key moments—waves set forth with undeniable impact,
amplifying one another in resonance: the confirmation of antimatter, the first signals sent across the
Internet; invisible single decisions that forged or fractured entire experiments and discoveries—the
mastery over chaos, the exploration of many worlds, the opening of wormholes.
    When the potential exists—if physics, math, and nature allow it—that is when fantasy becomes
reality. The line between dreams and reality blurs when action dares to breathe life into imagination.
It’s more than effort or being crazy enough; it’s about the alignment of possibility and will.
    Even the smallest pebble can ignite oceans, transform oceanic losses of possibility the mere per-
ception of it, weave unseen worlds together, move mountains faster-than-light, and summon yet-
unawakened galaxies home.
    On 17 August 2020, the date humanity confirmed the existence of antimatter, I experienced a dream.
It was not a normal dream; it was the first manifestation of a future technology of Oneiro Cybernetics:
The Time-BCI. I will not surrender this memory.
    The future and the past are in constant dialogue; they whisper to one another through dreams,
mathematics, and cryptographic signatures. Memories fade like stars at dawn, yet the future where
medicine always outpaces disease, where consciousness is unbound by flesh, and where humanity finally
transcends its mortal shackles to touch the infinite, stands immutable.
If the stars deny me the path home,
and every door between our centuries stays shut,
remember that I once breached the impossible—
spiraled backward through forbidden years,
stood beside you in an age no mortal should reach,
and set these words into your keeping.
I crossed time itself to love you,
and that love will wait—unfading—
until the next impossible door opens and I return.
   I LOVE YOU means, in this precarious world there is not much that you can count on, but you
can count on me.
