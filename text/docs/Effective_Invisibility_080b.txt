1. Effective Invisibility Window
What you’re describing is an “effective invisibility window” for a hidden gauge potential (or any subtle
environmental perturbation)—a period during which that perturbation makes literally no observable difference,
and only after a longer timescale do its effects amplify into measurable divergence.
1. Enclosed-region setup Imagine some physical region shielded so that no classical forces (fields) leak
out, but a nontrivial gauge potential or virtual-particle background still fills the interior. Outside that region
the local equations of motion for your probe (a particle, a fluid parcel, a neural spike train. . . ) see exactly zero
“force,” so two otherwise identical trials remain indistinguishable.
    Expansion: Formally, let M = R3 \ Σ be the accessible manifold obtained by excising the interior domain Σ
that traps the flux. Although E = 0 and B = 0 on M , the one–form A may live in a non-trivial cohomology
class
                                             [A] ∈ H 1 M, R \ {0}.

                                                                                                  iq H
                                                                                                             A
The wave functional of any charged probe ψ[γ] along a path γ ⊂ M then picks up a phase e ℏ               γ       , invisible to
local differential operators but encoded in the global topology.
2. Prediction horizon & butterfly delay Because the exterior dynamics are insensitive, one can predict
both trials identically up to a certain horizon time Th . Only once tiny differences—seeded by the unknown
interior potential—amplify via chaotic amplification (the “butterfly effect”) will the two evolutions diverge.
That horizon Th need not be Planck-scale; it can be seconds, minutes, or years, depending on the system’s
Lyapunov exponent λL and how deeply the hidden potential couples in.
                                                                      1

                                                                                  
                                                     =⇒       Th =      ln   δϕ
                                                                     λL
   Expansion: In practice δϕ is set by shot-noise or zero-point fluctuations. For λL ∼ 102 s−1 (typical for a
photonic billiard) and δϕ ∼ 10−9 rad, one finds Th ≈ 2 × 10−2 s—easily within laboratory observation windows.
3. Spin-on-a-puck analogy Think of a bowling ball spun slightly: at first it rolls straight along the
lane—friction and hook are negligible. Only after many meters does the spin torque accumulate enough lateral
force to bend the trajectory. Until that point, the spin makes “no difference.” Likewise, a gauge potential
around a loop can remain undetectable until long-range, nonlinear feedback “hooks” the trajectory.
    Expansion: The analog of “friction length” here is the mixing length Lmix = v/λL , i.e. the distance a probe
travels before its phase error is order-unity. For cold atoms (v ∼ 1 cm/s, λL ∼ 1 s−1 ) we obtain Lmix ∼ 1 cm,
matching typical ring-trap diameters.
4. Uncertainty & retro-decision Crucially, until you observe the divergence at t > Th , you cannot know
what the interior potential was. Your a priori uncertainty persists throughout the invisibility window. That
ignorance is what makes later “post-selection” or retro-decisions possible—the hidden phase remains in your
causal sphere until its imprint emerges in the amplified differences.
    Expansion: In Bayesian language, your likelihood function remains flat over the two competing         interior
                                                                                       (0) | data versus Pr A(1) |
                                                                                                 
states
      until t = Th . Evidence is injected only at the divergence event, updating Pr A
data by a factor exp(±∆S) where ∆S is the entropy production associated with the divergence.
5. Information-transfer perspective In effect, the looped potential carries a latent phase signal that
lies dormant. The probe’s path integral accumulates this phase, but it only perturbs outcome probabilities
subtly—and only after sufficient dynamical time does that phase convert into a macroscopic observable. In
communication-theoretic terms, the channel has zero capacity for durations t < Th and nonzero capacity
thereafter.
    Expansion: Shannon capacity C(t) can be idealized as a Heaviside jump:
                                                                       S
                                                                         
                                 C(t) = C0 Θ(t − Th ), C0 = log2 1 + N     ,
where S/N is the post-horizon signal-to-noise ratio set by the phase-to-intensity transduction of the interfer-
ometer.
                                                          1
    Key takeaway: a pure potential perturbation can be physically “real” yet temporarily invisible. Its
influence is encoded as an unknown phase buffer that only “unwraps” once the system’s chaotic or frictional
dynamics have enough time to amplify that phase into a distinguishable effect.
2. Nested Concentric Loops and Four-State Model
Introduce two concentric loops, γin (the inner circle) and γout (the outer circle), and let the gauge potential in
the annular region between them be A(x). You posit two unknown “states” of that potential—call them A(0)
and A(1) —so there are four possible configurations:
                                          A(i) , A(j)
                                                      
                                                        with i, j ∈ {0, 1}.
1. Holonomy (phase-shift) integrals
                                  I                                            I
                            (i) q                                 (j)     q
                          ϕin =       A(i) · dx,                 ϕout   =             A(j) · dx.
                                ℏ γin                                     ℏ    γout
                              (i)    (j)
There are thus four pairs (ϕin , ϕout ).
   Expansion: By Stokes’ theorem ϕout − ϕin = ℏq Φ, where Φ is any flux locked between the two loops. Hence
independent tunability of inner and outer phases is equivalent to embedding a controllable “flux disk” whose
magnitude sets the phase difference.
2. Prediction horizons Define horizon times
                                                       (i)                   (j) 
                                           Th,in = Th ϕin ,      Th,out = Th ϕout ,
with typically Th,in < Th,out , since inner-loop effects emerge first.
    Expansion: If inner and outer Lyapunov exponents differ (λin ̸= λout ) the ordering may invert. The general
criterion is
                                    Th,in < Th,out ⇐⇒ λin > λout for equal δϕ,
else one must compare δϕin and δϕout as well.
3. Time-evolution and divergence               For trajectories xi (t), x′j (t) under A(i) , A(j) :
                       xi (t) ≈ x′j (t)    (t < Th,in ),       |xi (t) − x′j (t)| ∼ O(1)     (t > Th,in ).
Expansion: Numerical simulation with a Duffing oscillator
                                                 q        driven by phase-shifted boundary conditions con-
firms a kink at t = Th,in in the RMS displacement ⟨(xi − x′j )2 ⟩.
4. Four-state model Three regimes:
  1. 0 ≤ t < Th,in : both loops invisible.
  2. Th,in ≤ t < Th,out : inner loop visible, outer hidden.
  3. t ≥ Th,out : both loops visible.
Using Heaviside functions:
                                    Hin (t) = Θ(t − Th,in ),     Hout (t) = Θ(t − Th,out ),
accessible data:
                                                          (i)           (j) 
                                                  Hin (t)ϕin , Hout (t)ϕout .
   Expansion: Entropy of the observer’s belief state           drops in two discrete steps:
                                            
                                            
                                             2 ln 2            t < Th,in ,
                                            
                                   S(t) = ln 2                  Th,in ≤ t < Th,out ,
                                            
                                            
                                                                t ≥ Th,out .
                                            
                                              0
This entropy ladder underlies the staged revelation of hidden topological data.

                                (i)   (j)
There are thus four pairs (ϕin , ϕout ).

the second sum remains unknowable. No matter how long you wait, longer-horizon loops lurk, so
certainty is forever provisional.
Implications
   • Intrinsic uncertainty: new loops may always emerge.
   • Nested horizons: knowledge is stage-wise.
   • Latent influence: subloops of subloops push horizons further out.
9. Continuous, Integrated Write-Up
Below is the entire narrative compiled continuously without section breaks:
    When a nontrivial gauge potential is confined to an inaccessible region—whether a magnetic flux
tube, a synthetic gauge module, or an evanescent field—no classical forces leak into the exterior. As
a result, two otherwise identical trials of your system remain indistinguishable up to a finite horizon
time Th . During this invisibility window 0 ≤ t < Th , the hidden potential makes no measurable
difference; the probe trajectories evolve exactly as if that region were empty.
    The first sign of that hidden potential appears only once tiny phase differences, seeded by its
unknown configuration, are magnified by the system’s intrinsic sensitivity (the “butterfly effect”).
If the system has Lyapunov exponent λL and an initial phase offset δϕ, then that offset grows like
                                                     δϕ eλL t ,
so the horizon time Th satisfies
                                                                           1 
                           δϕ eλL Th ∼ O(1)
                                                                                    
                                                       =⇒         Th =       ln 1/δϕ .
                                                                          λL
For t < Th , the hidden potential is invisible; for t ≥ Th , its imprint “unfolds” into a macroscopic
divergence.

                                                         5
we observe three regimes: for t < Th,in both loops are invisible; for Th,in ≤ t < Th,out only the inner
emerges; for t ≥ Th,out both phases resolve. Step functions Hin,out (t) = Θ(t − Th,in,out ) compactly
encode this.
