0. Context
This note extends the prior loop/gauge formalism for self-consistent retrocausal dynamics by introduc-
ing gated multi-wormhole networks. Intuitively: (i) many closed information-carrying loops coexist;
(ii) wormhole throats act as tunable couplers whose effective transparency and phase are controlled
by other wormholes (“a wormhole choking another”), or by holonomies of gauge potentials threaded
through nontrivial cycles; (iii) self-consistent histories arise as fixed points of a global transfer operator;
(iv) interference between loops selects originless eigenmodes (bootstrap solutions) that live on closed
paths; (v) the loop-preserved structure is captured by gauge-invariant holonomies, while microstate
details in the complement (periphery) fluctuate. Quantum scars supply the semiclassical picture: am-
plitudes concentrate on unstable periodic orbits (closed loops), and “gating” reshapes which scars
persist.
1. Topology and kinematics of a wormhole network
Model spacetime as a manifold M with a finite set of traversable wormhole throats {e ∈ E} producing
nontrivial topology (handle attachments). Abstract the kinematics by a directed multigraph G =
(V, E) whose edges e represent oriented throat transits and whose cycles C ⊂ E represent closed
causal/information paths (which may be timelike, nearly null, or effective CTCs in a computation-
theoretic sense).
    For a signal carrier (classical symbol, quantum amplitude, or hybrid) with angular frequency ω,
assign each edge a single-pass propagator
                                                p                             
                                                            i ωτe (ge )+ϕe (Φ)
                               Ue (ω, ge , Φ) =  ηe (ge ) e                     Re ,
where τe is the traversal delay, ηe ∈ [0, 1] the intensity transmission, ϕe a holonomy phase due to
gauge fluxes Φ threading noncontractible cycles, and Re an internal rotation/mixing on a finite mode
space (polarization/spin/channels). The “gate” variable ge (controlled locally or by another wormhole)
modulates ηe , τe ; ϕe depends only on Φ (Aharonov–Bohm-type holonomy). Composition around a cycle
C yields the cycle propagator
                                                     ⟲
                                                     Y
                                      UC (ω, g, Φ) =   Ue (ω, ge , Φ).
                                                       e∈C
A closed-loop (single-roundtrip) phase is φC = argTr UC (for scalar modes φC is simply the phase of
the product).
Holonomy and knot/link data. Let {Ci } be a basis of independent cycles (first homology H1 ).
Let {Σk } be independent 2-cycles dual to handles that carry U (1) fluxes Φk . The Aharonov–Bohm
phase accumulated on Ci is
                                                q X
                                     ϕCi (Φ) =        Lik Φk ,
                                                ℏ k
where Lik ∈ Z is the linking number between Ci and Σk . This captures “closed AB paths” in a multiply
connected geometry and extends naturally to non-Abelian holonomies.
                                                      1
2. Fixed-point (bootstrap) modes and originlessness
Let a collect complex mode amplitudes on a set of reference cross-sections (e.g., immediately after each
throat). One roundtrip of all loops defines a global transfer operator
                                               U(ω, g, Φ) a = a.
Nontrivial solutions a ̸= 0 exist iff det(I − U) = 0. These are bootstrap modes: closed-loop eigenstates
whose support is confined to cycles. They possess no external “source” in the usual causal sense;
rather, they are fixed points of the network evolution under loop closure. Spectrally, they are the
1-eigenvectors of U, or, for lossy networks, the Perron modes of largest modulus (with gain provided
by feedback subloops, parametric drive, or boundary conditions).
Quantization by holonomy. In scalar, single-cycle limit, the consistency reduces to
                              p
                                ηC (g) e i(ωτC (g)+ϕC (Φ)) = 1,
so ηC (g) = 1 and ωτC (g)+ϕC (Φ) = 2πn. In multi-cycle networks the constraints couple through shared
edges and junction scattering; holonomies ϕCi act like topological “knobs” that slide the spectrum.
3. Gating by wormholes: “choking” as a control primitive
A second wormhole can gate a throat e by altering its effective redshift profile, tidal geometry, or quan-
tum stress-energy, which we package into ge . Operationally, gating implements a controlled deformation
                           (ηe , τe ) 7→ (ηe (g), τe (g)),       ∂g ηe ≤ 0,   ∂g τe ≥ 0,
i.e., increased choking lowers transparency and increases dwell time. Crucially, choking an edge in one
loop modifies all cycles that contain e, and thus all fixed-point constraints in which e participates.
Transistor/MOSFET analogy. Identify two distinguished loops as “source” and “drain” cycles,
CS , CD , that exchange amplitude through a shared subpath containing a gated edge eg . A third loop
(the “gate loop”) CG controls either geg (through geometric back-reaction/quantum inequalities) or the
holonomy ϕCG (Φ) that shifts interference at a coupler shared with CS ∪ CD . The small parameter δg
or δΦ then yields a large change in occupation of the drain eigenmode when U sits near a spectral
degeneracy (avoided crossing), i.e.,
                               d                   1
                                 |aCD |2 ∝                   ,          λ ∈ {g, Φ},
                              dλ           minj |1 − λj (λ)|
with {λj } the eigenvalues of U. This is the interferometric gain mechanism (cf. SQUID-like control in
phase space).
4. Interference of quantum scars across nested boundaries
In chaotic ray/trajectory limits, closed unstable orbits {γ} support quantum scars: enhanced amplitude
of eigenmodes near γ. In our setting, cycles C (topological) and orbits γ (dynamical) coincide in the
semiclassical support of bootstrap modes. When two loops share segments or enclose oneRanother, their
scar subspaces are non-orthogonal and interfere. Gating adjusts (i) action phases S[γ] = γ p·dx−ω∆t,
(ii) AB phases ϕ, and (iii) local stabilities. The net effect is a selection among competing scarred
eigenmodes via a topological-dynamical Fano interference:
                                           X
                                     ψ =      Aγ (g, Φ) e i(S[γ]/ℏ+ϕγ (Φ)) ,
                                             γ∈Γ
with amplitudes Aγ suppressed/enhanced by choking and by holonomy-controlled phase alignment.
                                                             2
5. Closed Aharonov–Bohm control and knot data
Let L be the integer linking matrix between basis cycles and threaded fluxes. Holonomies enter only
through LΦ; knotting/linking among loops therefore acts as a routing matrix for phase control. A
minimal two-loop gate has
                                                
                           ϕC1       q L11 L12      Φ1
                                 =                       , L12 = L21 ∈ Z.
                           ϕC2      ℏ    L21 L 22   Φ2
Tuning Φ2 (through C2 ) modulates ϕC1 if and only if L12 ̸= 0; this is the precise AB-mediated gating
criterion. In non-Abelian variants, holonomies are group elements and gating acts via conjugacy classes,
enabling richer switching (e.g., topological selection rules).
6. Consistency, memory, and what can/cannot change
Embed an agent with memory m = M (h) attempting to set a target variable z that lives on a holonomy
(e.g., the phase of a specific loop). As in the “no-target theorem,” if z is functionally entangled with
m across closure, the network equations force z to a fixed point z ⋆ compatible with m(z ⋆ ). Therefore:
   • Invariant (code) layer: cycle holonomies {ϕCi } and roundtrip delays {τCi } that are logically
     referenced by the agent’s own recollection behave as fixed invariants.
   • Periphery layer: local scattering phases, mode partitions, and amplitudes orthogonal to the
     invariant algebra fluctuate and can carry coordination signals. Gating steers which periphery
     channels dominate by moving the spectrum of U, while leaving the invariants intact.
Pragmatically, we shape which bootstrap mode wins, not an invariant that is coupled to memory.
7. Minimal algebra: two loops with a shared, gated throat
Let a1 , a2 be complex roundtrip amplitudes on cycles C1 , C2 , each with intrinsic return factors r1 eiφ1
and r2 eiφ2 (including AB phases). A shared throat implements bidirectional coupling t(g) (real for
simplicity), yielding                     iφ               
                                   a1        r1 e 1 t(g)eiθ      a1
                                        =         iθ     iφ2         .
                                   a2       t(g)e    r2 e        a2
Nontrivial solutions require
                                 1 − r1 eiφ1 1 − r2 eiφ2 − t(g)2 e2iθ = 0.
                                                       
A small holonomy shift δφ2 = (q/ℏ)L2k δΦk or a small choke δt can toggle the existence/weight of the
a1 -dominated mode if the system sits near the root manifold above; this is the transistor-like action.
8. Multi-loop coordination (Schelling layer)
Given a family of networks {Gα } with different absolute durations but identical structure type (same
linking matrix L, same cycle adjacency), agents restricted to invariants (shared holonomies) can select
the same focal bootstrap mode by adopting a policy a = f ({ϕCi } mod 2π) that maximizes mutual
predictability. Gating then enforces that mode by spectral separation (opening a gap to competitors),
while periphery fluctuations distribute microscopic details. This directly realizes a Schelling-Point
Calculus on holonomy space.
                                                    3
9. Observables and signatures
   • Holonomy-tuned spectral flow: eigenfrequencies/roundtrip phases of bootstrap modes slide
     linearly with AB flux (∝ LΦ); near degeneracies, small flux shifts cause large amplitude realloca-
     tion (interferometric switching).
   • Gate choking response: as a single throat is pinched (ηe ↓), modes supported by cycles travers-
     ing e quench selectively; modes on disjoint cycles are unaffected except via interference terms.
   • Scar selection: spatial intensity maps (classical/semiclassical) reorganize along closed orbits
     consistent with the switched mode; overlapping scars show Fano-like lineshapes as gates sweep
     phases through resonance.
   • Invariance under memory coupling: quantities explicitly referenced in the agent’s recollection
     revert to loop-fixed values across attempts; only orthogonal observables wander.
10. Analog simulators (practical toy models)
The mathematics above is captured exactly by quantum graphs/wave networks:
  1. Photonic ring-resonator lattices: rings as cycles, tunable directional couplers as throats (gate
     via heater/EO phase shifter). AB holonomy via synthetic gauge fields (dynamic modulation).
     Bootstrap modes are lasing/oscillation eigenmodes in feedback.
  2. Microwave networks: coax/waveguide graphs with phase shifters and variable attenuators;
     direct readout of det(I − U) zeros (network resonances).
  3. Cold-atom circuits / atomtronics: superfluid on a ring with weak links; flux (rotation/artificial
     gauge field) controls Josephson phases; scars correspond to persistent-current states.
These platforms instantiate the transfer-operator, holonomy control, and gating physics without invok-
ing exotic spacetime engineering, yet faithfully test the fixed-point and interference logic.
11. Synthesis
A gated multi-wormhole network is a topological interferometer whose computational state is an eigen-
mode of a holonomy- and choke-controlled transfer operator. “Originless” information corresponds to
fixed points living on closed cycles. Control is exerted indirectly: not by forcing a memory-entangled
invariant (which self-consistency pins), but by spectrally selecting among admissible bootstrap modes
via (i) wormhole choking ( g ) and (ii) AB holonomy ( Φ ). Knot/link data encode who can gate whom.
Quantum scars provide the semiclassical geometry of where amplitude lives; gates and holonomies
sculpt those scars and thereby the realized loop-computation.
