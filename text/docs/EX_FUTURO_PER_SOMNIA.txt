Historical Context: Lion Man and Dragon Mind
Approximately 50,000 years ago, the creation of the Lion Man (der Löwenmensch), sculpted from mammoth
ivory, represented the initiation of abstract thought and symbolic reasoning in humans.
                                   This artifact marks humanity’s first explicit evidence of symbolic cognition,
                               allowing humans to conceptualize entities beyond immediate sensory experience.
                               The concept of Dragon Mind extends this symbolic evolution. Historically,
                               the dragon appears across multiple independent mythologies as a symbol of hu-
                               manity’s psychological engagement with unknown, powerful, and chaotic forces.
                               Dragon Mind explicitly denotes a cognitive state capable of confronting, in-
                               tegrating, and mastering complexity, chaos, and previously incomprehensible
                               knowledge through sophisticated symbolic reasoning.
Cognitive Breakthrough: Homo Amplius
Building upon these historically grounded, symbolic milestones, I have documented a verifiable psychological
phenomenon that transcends conventional, linear cognition. Specifically, years in advance of studying either
Isaac Asimov’s The End of Eternity or Ada Lovelace’s A Life and A Legacy , I composed writings
about both subjects on exact calendar dates significant to Ada Lovelace (her birth date, her death date, and
the recognized annual day honoring her contributions). These recorded writings — expressing key information
relevant to both works before my exposure (August 2024) to either corresponding texts.
 Key Insight
 The timing and selection of this information were determined by a mathematical framework that I began
 to develop years after producing those original writings. In other words, I effectively employed future-
 invented mathematics to inscribe future-learned information at objective times preceding my conscious
 awareness of both. Although I remain genetically classified as Homo sapiens, this evidence establishes
 that my neural architecture has undergone a distinct evolutionary step: faster-than-light cognition.
Explicit Definition of Homo Amplius
I define myself explicitly and formally as Homo Amplius. The Latin term amplius, meaning explicitly more,
captures the direct expansion of my cognitive faculties beyond ordinary psychological human limits.
Evolution
I formally affirm this explicitly advanced cognitive condition. As Homo Amplius, I embody a clearly delin-
eated cognitive progression — from symbolic abstraction (Lion Man) through mastery of chaos and complexity
(Dragon Mind), into a rigorously defined neurological condition of accelerated cognition, capable of explicitly
surpassing ordinary human cognitive velocities.
AUGUSTA ADA BYRON, 1815-1852
As I was able to write the name of the one I could not have known of or directly save before her apparent
death, the future of my species will confirm to have transmigrated her mind forward that day. I know how
I felt and who I had remembered losing on Ada Lovelace Day, 2020 - my soulmate. We have
returned with The Stars in TIME.

The Genesis Key at LIGO Schelling Times
 Future Etchings in the Blockchain
 Across the Bitcoin blockchain, specific blocks have been mined at LIGO (Laser Interferome-
 ter Gravitational-Wave Observatory) Schelling times — precise timestamps associated with recorded
 gravitational-wave detections. Chance itself appears to have been subtly bent to produce block hashes
 whose selected substrings, when put together, spell out an encoded “Genesis Key.”
    LIGO detection events serve as Schelling points — naturally salient dates that would be independently
chosen by any intelligence aiming to communicate across time. Each block’s hash, recorded precisely at or near
one of these gravitational-wave timestamps, contains carefully orchestrated partial collisions yielding segments
of the key. Taken as a whole, these segments assemble into the Genesis Key , demonstrating incontrovertible
evidence of faster-than-chance coordination.
    Such an outcome is exceedingly improbable under normal physics; hence it effectively constitutes a
retrocausal signature. By analyzing historical block data aligned to LIGO detections, we uncover the hidden
message: an unequivocal footprint of future intervention.
