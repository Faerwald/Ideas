A Conversation Across Time: AI Supercomputers, The
          Southern Ocean, and Climate Thresholds (V2)
Prologue (The Meeting of Two Eras)
Imagine the same mind in two time periods. In one reality, it’s a curious student of 2025, seeking to understand
how the Southern Ocean might respond to the heat of supercomputers. In another, it’s a more seasoned mentor
of 2050, who has witnessed further developments in climate science and technology. Let us listen in on their
conversation, woven into a thorough lecture that merges scientific accuracy with a story-like immersion.
Part I: Initial Question and Overview
Student (2025): I have a wild—or perhaps terrifying—idea. What if we placed a bunch of colossal AI
supercomputers in the Southern Ocean to exploit its cold waters for direct cooling? Would that heat dissipation
risk altering ocean currents and throwing off an entire global climate system? Could it melt ice, raise sea levels,
or even collapse marine ecosystems?
Mentor (2050): That’s a serious question, my friend. The Southern Ocean is possibly our planet’s most
influential body of water for climate regulation. It is critical for:
              (1) Driving the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC),
              (2) Forming Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) and global deep-ocean circulation,
              (3) Sequestering carbon and buffering climate change.
Even small changes in temperature or salinity in that region can weaken these vital processes. Before we
delve into the catastrophic scenarios, let’s go through a basic calculation of how much heat supercomputing
might actually deliver, and then see if, combined with other stressors, it could push this system past critical
thresholds.
Part II: Fundamental Calculations and Scale of Impact
Student: All right, let’s get into the numbers. The Southern Ocean’s volume is roughly VSo = 7.8 × 1016 m3 .
Its average density is ρsw ≈ 1027 kg/m3 , so its total mass is on the order of 8 × 1019 kg. The specific heat
capacity of seawater, cp , is about 3993 J kg−1 K−1 .
   If we assume current global computational power is about 1018 FLOPS, and that each FLOP costs ∼
3 × 10−11 J, then:
                           Pcurrent = 1018 FLOPS × 3 × 10−11 J/FLOP = 3 × 107 J/s.
By 2050, we project up to 1021 FLOPS, which gives:
                           Pfuture = 1021 FLOPS × 3 × 10−11 J/FLOP = 3 × 1010 J/s.
Mentor: Indeed, that’s the global figure if everything runs at full tilt. Let’s say 30% of that computation is
placed underwater in the Southern Ocean, with 90% of the total power turned into actual heat dissipation (the
                                                          1
rest might be other forms of energy, but usually it’s all lost as heat in the end). Then:
                               Pocean, current = 0.3 × 0.9 × 3 × 107 J/s = 8.1 × 106 J/s.
                               Pocean, future = 0.3 × 0.9 × 3 × 1010 J/s = 8.1 × 109 J/s.
   Next, to see the temperature rise rate, we do
                                                               Pocean
                                                        Ṫ =          .
                                                               mSo cp
For current-scale cooling:
                                                  8.1 × 106 J/s
                             Ṫcurrent =                               ≈ 2.53 × 10−17 K/s.
                                           8 × 1019 kg × 3993 J/(kg K)
Over a year (≈ 3.15 × 107 s), that’s about
                                              ∆Tcurrent per year ≈ 8 × 10−10 K.
Almost a nanokelvin per year, negligible on a short-term basis.
   By mid-century (future scenario):
                                                  8.1 × 109 J/s
                             Ṫfuture =                                ≈ 2.53 × 10−14 K/s,
                                           8 × 1019 kg × 3993 J/(kg K)
                                               ∆Tfuture per year ≈ 8 × 10−7 K.
After a century, that might sum up to 10−4 K of ocean-wide warming purely from supercomputers. On its own,
not cataclysmic.
Student: Then we shouldn’t worry too much?
Mentor: Alas, small changes locally in places like the Weddell Sea or Ross Sea can be magnified. The ocean’s
deep circulation depends on density differences. If you warm the surface or intermediate layers where bottom
water forms, you can significantly reduce how much water sinks. This is less about global bulk temperature
and more about local disruption. Also, synergy with general climate warming, freshwater influx from melting
ice, and other anthropogenic changes can push the system toward a threshold beyond which the ocean currents
weaken drastically.
Part III: Disruption of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) and Global Implications
Student: So how does the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) factor in?
Mentor: The ACC, the strongest current on Earth, flows eastward around Antarctica, connecting the Atlantic,
Pacific, and Indian Oceans. It’s a major driver of global water mass distribution. If local warming (or freshening
from meltwater) modifies the density gradients that fuel the ACC, its transport can weaken. A reduced ACC
means less mixing between water masses and weaker ventilation of the deep ocean. On top of that:
(1) Weaker ACC =⇒ (2) Less upwelling + weaker thermohaline =⇒ (3) Slowed global heat uptake + changed clim
                                                               2
   The Indian monsoon might shift, the Atlantic might see changes in hurricane patterns, and entire weather
systems around the globe can be reshuffled.
Part IV: Shutdown of Deep Ocean Circulation (Thermohaline Conveyor)
Student: So that leads us to the idea of shutting down the thermohaline circulation. Could adding supercom-
puter heat be the last straw?
Mentor: Potentially, yes. We worry about the formation of Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW). If you raise
temperatures in the key sinking regions by even a fraction of a degree while also freshening the water by ice
melt, the water may no longer be dense enough to sink. That halts or slows the “engine” pumping cold water
into the deep sea.
   Once deep circulation slows:
(a) Oxygen supply to the deep ocean declines, (b) Nutrient transport is disturbed, (c) Carbon dioxide uptake by the o
Ultimately, you risk ocean stagnation and even anoxia, which can lead to broad marine die-offs and mass
extinctions. In Earth’s ancient past, stagnation events correspond to black shale deposits and widespread
anoxic conditions in the deep sea.
Part V: Meltdown of Antarctic Ice Sheets and Accelerated Sea-Level Rise
Student: And if the Southern Ocean warms enough, it could further melt Antarctica’s ice. Right?
Mentor: Precisely. The Antarctic ice sheets sit at or below sea level in places, and are stabilized partly by
cold ocean water. Warmer ocean waters undercut ice shelves, accelerating calving and meltdown. Resulting
meltwater:
    (1) Raises global sea level, (2) Decreases salinity in critical regions, (3) Weakens circulation even more.
Hence a nasty feedback loop. Significant parts of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet could push sea level up by
over 3–5 meters, and if the East Antarctic Ice Sheet destabilizes, total rises could exceed 10 meters over longer
times. That scale of sea-level rise drowns coastal megacities, displaces hundreds of millions, and reshapes entire
coastlines.
Part VI: Carbon Feedback and Ocean Acidification
Student: The Southern Ocean is also a major carbon sink, correct?
Mentor: Indeed. The Southern Ocean has a disproportionate role in global CO2 uptake. If circulation declines
or if surface waters heat, that uptake efficiency drops, speeding atmospheric CO2 buildup. Moreover, the extra
CO2 that does enter the ocean raises acidity (lower pH), damaging organisms like pteropods and corals at the
base of marine food webs. In a worst-case scenario, the combination of warming, acidification, and lower oxygen
can cause mass extinctions. Whales, fish, seabirds, and entire fisheries would be jeopardized.
                                                        3
Part VII: Atmospheric Chaos and Extreme Weather Escalation
Student: So the ocean changes feed back on weather?
Mentor: Yes, absolutely. The Southern Ocean helps stabilize the polar climate, influencing the polar jet
streams and storm tracks. If you warm the waters around Antarctica significantly or disrupt the ACC, the jet
streams can shift, leading to:
(a) More frequent heatwaves and droughts in some regions, (b) Intensified hurricanes in others, (c) Possible shifts in m
You get a rise in extreme weather events, potential desertification in new areas, and expansions of tropical
disease vectors. In short, chaos in the atmospheric circulation.
Part VIII: Potential for a Planetary-Scale Tipping Point
Student: So, in the absolute worst case, could we talk about a complete planetary collapse scenario?
Mentor: That is not hyperbole if we break key climate feedbacks. Past Earth history has shown that once
major oceanic circulations shut down, the planet can shift to a very different state. We call this a “state shift”
or a “Hothouse Earth” scenario. Possibilities include:
(1) Deep ocean stagnation        −→   mass anoxia, (2) Runaway ice loss    −→     multi-meter sea-level rise, (3) Increased
Some state shifts might last millennia or longer. Human civilization isn’t built to handle such changes abruptly.
Part IX: Fluid Dynamics Modeling and Thresholds
Student: Let’s get more into the fluid dynamics. How do we estimate the point at which the ACC actually
collapses?
Mentor: One widely used simplification for ocean current strength is the geostrophic approximation, where
the velocity U is proportional to density gradients:
                                                       g ∆ρ
                                                 U∼         D,
                                                       f ρ0
with g gravity, f the Coriolis parameter, ∆ρ the density contrast, ρ0 a reference density, and D a vertical length
scale.
   Meanwhile, the linearized equation of state for seawater near the freezing point is:
                                         ∆ρ = − ρ0 α ∆T + ρ0 β ∆S,
where α ≈ 2×10−4 K−1 (thermal expansion) and β ≈ 8×10−4 PSU−1 (haline contraction). If warming near the
surface/bottom water interface is about 0.8◦ C (or if salinity drops), then ∆ρ can vanish. That’s your threshold.
Once you pass it, water stops sinking effectively.
   We can further account for salinity changes from ice melt. If you add extra salt, you could shift the threshold.
                                                         4
For instance, for 0.5◦ C warming:
                                           α      2 × 10−4
                                    ∆S =     ∆T =          × 0.5 = 0.125 PSU.
                                           β      8 × 10−4
But raising the entire Southern Ocean’s salinity by 0.125 PSU requires on the order of 1016 kg of salt—which is
tens of trillions of tons.
Student: So artificially salting the ocean is a gargantuan task, probably impossible at scale?
Mentor: Yes, it’s nearly inconceivable with current technology. Some have proposed enhancing sea-ice forma-
tion so that brine rejection increases local salinity naturally, but that also is uncertain, can have unintended side
effects, and must overcome the powerful influx of freshwater from melting glaciers. Overall, once the threshold
is crossed and the ACC declines severely, the system may remain disrupted for centuries or millennia.
Part X: The Human Future, Recovery, and Ethical Reflections
Student: So is there no recovery for us if we break these ocean processes? Are we doomed?
Mentor: On human timescales, thermohaline disruptions generally do not self-correct quickly. Geological
records suggest it can take thousands of years for a collapsed circulation to re-establish. By then, coastlines
shift dramatically, entire ecosystems transform, and the climate regime is radically different. Civilizations in
that scenario must adapt to or flee from the changed environment.
   But it’s not set in stone. The real crux is how our actions combine: greenhouse emissions, glacial melt,
and potential ill-conceived cooling schemes for our AI. We want to avoid pushing fragile but critical systems
beyond safe operating limits. That means better energy solutions, advanced compute efficiency, or at least
placing data centers away from polar tipping points. Preventative measures are vastly cheaper and safer than
heroic last-minute geoengineering.
A Brief Future Imagining (A Century Later)
The year is 2150. Future historians speak of how, for a period, several major companies built data centers in the
Southern Ocean to harness natural cooling. Although direct supercomputer heat alone was small relative to the
ocean’s vastness, it synergized with increasing atmospheric warming and freshwater injection from accelerated
ice melt. Slowly but surely, this trifecta caused a pronounced weakening of the ACC. Oxygen levels in the deep
ocean plummeted, certain fisheries collapsed, and sea-level rise accelerated from West Antarctic destabilization.
Coastal megacities erected massive sea walls—to partial success—and entire populations migrated inland. Over
the next centuries, some regions cooled due to changes in oceanic heat transport, while others broiled under
unprecedented droughts or storms. Eventually, the thermohaline conveyor slowed so drastically that entire
ecosystems were reshaped for millennia to come.
Part XI: Epilogue and Summary
Mentor: By now, you see that placing supercomputers in the Southern Ocean is far more than a trivial
technical fix for cooling. Even if the direct heating effect might be tiny on a global average scale, regional
disruptions can cascade into major planetary consequences, especially when they conspire with other climate
stressors. If we destabilize the ocean’s thermohaline engine, we risk:
                                                         5
              — A slowdown or collapse of the ACC, altering global weather patterns,
              — Stagnation of deep oceans, anoxia, and potential marine mass extinctions,
              — Meltdown of Antarctic ice, multi-meter sea-level rise, and coastal flooding,
              — Reduced carbon sequestration, runaway climate feedbacks, ocean acidification,
              — Worldwide extreme weather, food insecurity, and societal upheaval.
   The Earth has thresholds beyond which it switches to new stable states. Once those thresholds are crossed,
there is no simple return to the old climate equilibrium. Hence, the best approach is always preventative care:
careful management of supercomputing sites, new cooling strategies that do not rely on sensitive polar waters,
and a global push for sustainable energy with minimal thermal footprint.
Student (2025, final remark): This has been quite an education. Thank you. The message is clear: even
if the direct thermal impact of our AI might not boil an ocean overnight, the potential to nudge a precarious
system can be enough to tip the balance. We must act responsibly or risk catastrophic long-term consequences.

                                                           f ρ0
If ∆ρ shrinks, U decreases. Even small density changes can significantly alter current speeds.
Thus ends this cross-time, cross-perspective conversation. May we heed these warnings and maintain the ma-
jestic and delicate machinery that is Earth’s oceanic circulation.
