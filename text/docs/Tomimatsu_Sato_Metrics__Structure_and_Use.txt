Tomimatsu–Sato Metrics: Structure and Use
Scope and Guarantees
This paper develops the Tomimatsu–Sato (TS) family beyond brief mentions: the Papapetrou–Ernst
framework, prolate spheroidal coordinates, dressing/finite-soliton construction, pole-trajectory sectors,
asymptotics and axis regularity, multipole hierarchy (vs. Kerr), horizon/ergoregion/singularity structure,
and concrete computation templates (moments, invariants, geodesics, holonomies). All equations below
are definition-level anchors (no invented coefficients); when explicit polynomials are required in practice,
we point to the algorithmic steps to obtain them from the dressing data.
1    Stationary Axisymmetry: Papapetrou–Ernst Frame
Verbal
Any stationary, axisymmetric vacuum spacetime admits a canonical form: time translations and rotations
are symmetries, so the metric is determined by two scalar functions (plus a conformal factor) on a 2D
space of orbits. A single complex potential (Ernst) encodes the coupled Einstein equations into one
nonlinear equation with good integrability properties. This is the entry point for exact families like Kerr
and Tomimatsu–Sato.
Anchors (Minimal)
Papapetrou form.
               ds2 = −f (dt − ω dϕ)2 + f −1 e2γ (dρ2 + dz 2 ) + ρ2 dϕ2 ,
                                                                     
                                                                           f, ω, γ = f (ρ, z).
Ernst potential (vacuum). Let E(ρ, z) = f + iΨ; then the Ernst equation on the flat (ρ, z) base is
                                          (ℜE) ∇2 E = ∇E · ∇E.
Given E, one recovers f and ω by line integration, and γ from quadratures.
2    Coordinates for TS: Prolate Spheroidal
Verbal
TS solutions are most transparent in prolate spheroidal coordinates (x, y) adapted to the axis: spheres
and spheroids become coordinate surfaces, and asymptotic flatness is clean. A single length κ > 0 sets
the scale; the Weyl coordinates (ρ, z) are rational functions of (x, y).
Anchors
                            p
                       ρ = κ (x2 − 1)(1 − y 2 ),        z = κxy,    x ≥ 1, |y| ≤ 1.
All metric functions f, ω, γ are functions of (x, y).

3    The TS Family: Definition and Parameters
Verbal
The TS family is a countable set of stationary, axisymmetric, asymptotically flat vacuum solutions
labelled by an integer distortion index δ ≥ 1 and two continuous parameters that fix mass and rotation.
For δ = 1 the solution reduces to Kerr. For δ > 1 the spacetime is still vacuum and asymptotically flat
but no longer a black hole: it typically exhibits ring singularities and closed timelike curves, making TS
a controlled non-Kerr laboratory with tunable multipoles.
Anchors
Ernst rational form. In prolate (x, y), TS admits
                                                  A(x, y) − B(x, y)
                                      E(x, y) =                     ,
                                                  A(x, y) + B(x, y)
where A, B are real polynomials of total degree δ in (x, y) with symmetry constraints ensuring asymptotic
flatness and axis regularity. The metric functions follow by standard Ernst reconstruction.
4    Construction: Dressing and Finite-Soliton Data
Verbal
TS metrics arise from integrable constructions: one solves an auxiliary linear spectral problem (Lax
pair) whose monodromy encodes the nonlinear field. Imposing that the monodromy has a finite set of
simple poles (the “solitons”) yields an algebraic dressing matrix. The locations of these poles and their
residues are the discrete/continuous data from which A, B are built.
Anchors
                                                                                 (0)
Dressing system. With background fields (f (0) , ω (0) ) and Lax matrices Uµ , the dressing matrix
χ(w; xµ ) obeys
                               ∂µ χ = Λν µ Uν χ − χ Uν(0) ,
                                                             
with χ meromorphic in the spectral parameter w. TS corresponds to a finite set of simple poles {wk }
whose trajectories in (x, y) define sectors (next section).
5    Sector Topology: Pole Trajectories and “In/Out”
Verbal
As spacetime coordinates vary, each spectral pole traces an allowed path. Reality, asymptotic flatness,
and axis regularity forbid crossing certain cuts or leaving permitted sheets. Different global assignments
(e.g., whether a given pole stays “inside” or “outside” a barrier) cannot be deformed into each other
without breaking the solution: they are distinct topological sectors. TS branches at fixed (δ, mass, spin)
are thus discretized by sector labels. This is the cleanest way to see why small parameter tweaks cannot
morph a TS branch into Kerr unless the sector changes (which would destroy the solution).
6    Multipoles: How TS Deviates from Kerr
Verbal
Kerr’s entire infinite tower of Geroch–Hansen moments is fixed by mass M and spin parameter a via
a single recursion: each higher moment is a power of ia. TS( δ > 1 ) violates this Kerr relation in
                                                     2
a controlled manner: the spin multipoles and mass multipoles are still axisymmetric and reflection-
symmetric, but the quadrupole and all higher even mass moments differ from the Kerr values for the
same (M, J). Physically, TS is more oblate (more negative quadrupole) than Kerr at the same M, J.
Anchors (Extraction Method)
    • Place the Ernst potential on the symmetry axis (ρ = 0), expand at spatial infinity (z → ∞), and
      use the standard axis-expansion algorithm (e.g. Geroch–Hansen / Fodor–Hoenselaers–Perjés) to
      read off mass M0 , M2 , M4 , . . . and current S1 , S3 , . . . moments.
    • For Kerr: M0 = M , S1 = J, and Mℓ + iSℓ = M (ia)ℓ for ℓ ≥ 0.
    • For TS with δ > 1: M0 = M and S1 = J by asymptotics, but M2 (quadrupole) and higher
      moments deviate; deviation grows with δ.
7     Regularity: Horizons, Ergosurfaces, and Singularities
Verbal
Kerr has a regular event horizon (for subextremal spin). TS with δ > 1 generically lacks a regular horizon:
the would-be horizon surface is replaced by ring singularities and regions with closed timelike curves near
the ring. An ergosurface (where gtt = 0) still exists and can have complicated, even multi-lobed shapes
that grow with δ. TS is therefore not a black hole—it is a tuned vacuum spacetime whose controlled
pathologies make it a useful testbed: you can push on higher multipoles without the rigidity of the Kerr
relation.
Anchors (Diagnostics)
    • Axis regularity (elementary flatness). Demand that the conical deficit vanishes on both axis
      segments; this fixes integration constants in γ.
    • Horizon test. Look for a closed null surface where the Killing generator ∂t + ΩH ∂ϕ becomes null.
      For TS(δ > 1) this typically fails globally.
    • Ring singularity. Detect by curvature invariants (e.g. Kretschmann Rabcd Rabcd ) diverging on a
      ring in the equatorial plane.
    • CTC region. Check the sign of gϕϕ ; gϕϕ < 0 indicates closed timelike azimuthal loops.
8     How to Compute TS Objects Reliably
Verbal
You rarely need explicit closed polynomials (A, B) by hand. Instead: (i) generate them algorithmically
from dressing data, (ii) reconstruct (f, ω, γ) numerically, (iii) extract multipoles and invariants by series
and sampling. This avoids coefficient errors and keeps you honest.
Anchors (Pipelines)
    1. Finite-soliton generation. Choose δ and dressing poles {wk } satisfying reality/regularity; solve
       for residues to match asymptotics. Output: A(x, y), B(x, y).
    2. Metric reconstruction. Compute f = ℜE; integrate for ω on the (ρ, z) base (path-independently
       by Ernst integrability); integrate for γ from the first-order constraints.
                                                     3
    3. Multipoles via axis expansion. Place ρ = 0, expand E(z) at infinity, and apply the standard
       moment algorithm to read off {Mℓ , Sℓ }.
    4. Invariants and regions. Sample K = Rabcd Rabcd ; solve gtt = 0 for ergosurfaces; locate gϕϕ = 0
       for CTC boundaries; verify axis regularity.
9     Why TS is Perfect for Your A-wave/Holonomy Program
Verbal
Holonomy encodes information in loops, not points. TS offers rich but deterministic geometry with
tunable multipoles and nontrivial topology of timelike/azimuthal loops. That lets you:
    • Compare loop phases (gravitational Sagnac / gravitomagnetic holonomies) across families with
      identical (M, J) but different higher multipoles (Kerr vs. TS). Any robust difference isolates the
      contribution of deviating multipoles.
    • Stress-test gauge/holonomy encodings against pathological regions (CTCs, ring singularities) in a
      controlled way before moving to messy numerics.
    • Use sector labels (pole-trajectory topology) as discrete dials in your Schelling Point Calculus:
      loops that cannot be deformed between sectors provide protected signatures.
10      Minimal Core Equations (Safe Anchors)
Ernst Equation (Vacuum)
                         (ℜE) ∇2 E = ∇E · ∇E,          E = f + iΨ,    (ρ, z) flat base.
Prolate Coordinates
                                p
                           ρ = κ (x2 − 1)(1 − y 2 ),    z = κxy,     x ≥ 1, |y| ≤ 1.
TS Ernst Ansatz
            A(x, y) − B(x, y)
E(x, y) =                     ,   A, B real polynomials of total degree δ with symmetry/asymptotic constraints.
            A(x, y) + B(x, y)
Multipole Extraction (Axis Method, Schematic)
            Set ρ = 0, z → ∞, expand E(z) ⇒ {Mℓ , Sℓ } via standard axis-moment algorithm.
11      Checks and Invariants to Log in Code
    • Asymptotic flatness: f → 1, ω → 0, γ → 0 as r → ∞.
    • Mass and spin: read from leading asymptotic terms of f and ω; confirm M and J match inputs.
    • Axis regularity: elementary flatness on both axis segments (no conical defect).
    • Sector identification: record pole-trajectory winding/crossing data (“in/out” labels).
    • Region maps: level sets of gtt , gϕϕ ; divergence set of K = Rabcd Rabcd .
