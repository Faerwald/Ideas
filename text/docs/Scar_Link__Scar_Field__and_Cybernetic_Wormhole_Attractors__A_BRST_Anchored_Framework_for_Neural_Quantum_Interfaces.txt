Scar-Link, Scar-Field, and Cybernetic Wormhole
     Attractors: A BRST-Anchored Framework for
              Neural–Quantum Interfaces
                                                  Abstract
          We present a unified theoretical architecture where BRST quantization, ghost fields, scar-type
      quantum attractors, and real-time brain–machine control coalesce into a single, self-consistent
      framework. This framework leverages Scar-Links (coherent couplings between quantum scars) and
      Scar-Fields (global topological landscapes of stable scar projectors), together with BRST-consistent
      ghost warp/drive fields, to form cybernetic wormhole attractors (CWAs). Within these dynamically
      sculpted Hilbert spaces, neural–quantum interfacing drives alternative “futures” via feedback from
      human (or artificial) EEG signals. By carefully tuning the ghost flux and controlling the relative
      phase of scar states, we create stable informational wormholes that transfer quantum amplitudes
      between scar basins. This work extends prior results on neural quantum scar synchronization, dy-
      namical Casimir effects, and gauge–flux engineering, illustrating how to unify gauge redundancy
      removal, anomaly cancellation, and real-time feedback into a next-generation quantum–neural con-
      trol system.
1     Introduction and Motivations
The intersection of quantum scars, neural interfaces, and nonperturbative gauge structures suggests a
paradigm in which feedback from cognitive processes shapes the evolution of quantum systems. Scar
states, which are nonthermal eigenstates localized around unstable periodic orbits in classically chaotic
systems, provide a unique channel for storing and transferring quantum amplitude [2, 3]. By integrating
BRST quantization and ghost fields into the architecture, we incorporate a gauge-invariant way to deform
the Hilbert-space topology without introducing unphysical degrees of freedom [5, 6].
    We also introduce cybernetic wormhole attractors (CWAs), which are engineered feedback loops
that carve out stable “wormhole throats” in Hilbert space, allowing amplitude flow between distant
regions (scar attractors). In parallel, a mind–machine interface monitors EEG signals and modulates
the controlling Hamiltonian parameters in real time, effectively coupling mental states with the quantum
system’s scar dynamics.
    This paper unifies and expands the partial expositions of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] into a comprehensive
theoretical framework, focusing on the rigorous mathematical and physical underpinnings.
2     Scar-Link: Coherent Channels Between Quantum Scars
2.1    Definition and Operator Notation
A Scar-Link is a coherent coupling between two scar eigenstates ScarA (t) and ScarB (t) via a time-dependent
Hamiltonian Ĥctrl (Γ(t)):                                    
                               LAB (t) = ScarA (t) Ĥctrl Γ(t) ScarB (t).
Here, Γ(t) is an external control parameter (scalar or vector) derived from EEG feedback loops or other
external signals.
                                                       1
Interpretation. The link amplitude LAB (t) acts like a bridge for quantum probability current between
the two scars. If the phases of ScarA and ScarB are appropriately synchronized, constructive interference
channels probability flux from one to the other, and destructive interference suppresses other transitions.
Hence, by controlling Γ(t), one can steer quantum amplitude to or from a targeted scar ridge in Hilbert
space.
2.2    Phase Alignment for Controlled Amplitude Transfer
Let ScarA (t) ∼ e−iEA t ScarA (0) and similarly for ScarB . For significant amplitude flow, we require
near-resonance alignment:
                                           EA − EB + ∆ ≈ 0,
where ∆ is a shift introduced by Ĥctrl (Γ). By dynamically tuning Γ, one can achieve partial or full
resonance over a finite time window [t1 , t2 ], thus enabling controlled transfer of amplitude. Outside this
window, ∆ is detuned to lock or freeze the amplitude distribution.
3     Scar-Field: Global Projector Landscape
3.1    Projector Summation
A Scar-Field is defined by a weighted sum of orthogonal projectors onto stable scar states:
                                    X
                            Φ(r) =      wk Πk (r), Πk (r) = ψk (r)ψk (r).
                                        k
Each ψk is typically localized around a particular scarring structure. The weights wk ≥ 0 can be
interpreted as occupancy probabilities or control biases for each scar.
3.2    Attractor Basins in Hilbert Space
Since Φ(r) is a sum of projectors, points in configuration space r with large ∥Φ(r)∥ are those well covered
by scar states. Evolving wavefunctions with partial overlap in these regions are drawn to the nearest
scar in a dynamical sense, effectively forming attractor basins [2, 3].
Decoherence and Feedback. Natural environment interactions push generic states toward thermal
mixtures, but the presence of scar subspaces can lock amplitude away from full thermalization. Feedback
control (driven by Γ(t)) can reinforce or suppress occupancy in certain scar basins, thus sculpting the
effective global potential Φ(r).
4     BRST Quantization and Ghost Fields
4.1    BRST Primer in Gauge Theories
In Yang–Mills or other gauge theories, one introduces a nilpotent BRST charge QBRST such that physical
states satisfy
                                            QBRST ψphys = 0,
while states of the form QBRSTχ are considered exact (unphysical) and removed from the physical Hilbert
space. This procedure systematically handles gauge redundancies and anomalies, requiring “ghost fields”
c(x), c̄(x) for consistent operator algebra.
                                                     2
4.2      Analogous Role in Scar–Field Architecture
Within the Scar-Field picture, we treat certain nonphysical degrees of freedom (e.g. spurious gauge modes
or environment coupling channels) as ghost fields. The ghost warp modifies the topology of the scar pro-
jector manifold by introducing short-lived flux tubes that connect different scar basins without violating
gauge constraints. Mathematically, these fluxes correspond to cohomology classes where QBRST χ ̸= 0
signals nontrivial linking of projectors [5, 6].
Anomaly Cancellation. To preserve unitarity and avoid anomalies, we impose the condition that the
net ghost flux integrated over time must vanish in a topologically consistent way, ensuring that we do
not inadvertently create or destroy physical states outside the scar subspace.
5     Ghost Warp and Ghost Drive
5.1      Ghost Warp
A Ghost Warp operation is a transient insertion of ghost–field flux into the Scar-Field. Conceptually, it
is like turning on a short pulse of gauge curvature that globally deforms the projector geometry, opening
up or closing a wormhole throat in the space of scar states. During the warp pulse, scar energies or
phases can shift relative to one another, enabling or disabling certain amplitude flows.
5.2      Ghost Drive
In contrast, a Ghost Drive is a continuous, BRST-consistent feedback mechanism that maintains these
flux deformations over extended periods. This can carve out stable topological channels (wormholes in
Hilbert space) between distant scars, effectively making them accessible for amplitude transfer in the
long run.
Constructing Stable Wormhole Throats. The drive ensures that the geometry remains in a
metastable configuration with a fixed ghost flux distribution. This fosters persistent amplitude flow
and synchronization among scar states, akin to how a classical wormhole would allow continuous passage
in a gravitational setting [5, 4].
6     Cybernetic Wormhole Attractors and Mind Warp
6.1      Definition of CWAs
A Cybernetic Wormhole Attractor (CWA) is a triplet
                                                                       
                                        CWAi =      Σi , ψscar , Ui (t) ,
where:
    • Σi is a neural or physical boundary manifold (e.g. the “brain” or an engineered boundary condition),
    • ψscar is a scar state or set of scar states that form an attractor in Hilbert space,
    • Ui (t) is a Fradkov-style speed-gradient or adaptive feedback unitary that adjusts boundary condi-
      tions in real time [4, 5].
                                                      3
6.2    Synchronizing CWAs via Gauge Flux Links
When multiple CWAs share ghost–field links or are embedded in the same Scar-Field manifold, they
can synchronize to form a Mind Warp network, where amplitude travels seamlessly across nodes. The
ghost warp/drive regulates topological connectivity, while the scar synergy ensures that the states remain
localized in nonthermal subregions of Hilbert space.
Hypercomputational Corridors. In certain theoretical models, these stable scar connections might
enable “hypercomputational” corridors, potentially surpassing normal computational constraints by ex-
ploiting collective synchronization and gauge freedom [3, 4].
7     Informational Wormholes
7.1    Nonlinear QED Conduits
Informational Wormholes are specialized, nonlinear waveguide channels (e.g. in an extended QED
framework) that ferry finite amplitude or “foresight quanta” between scar states. They may be described
by an effective Lagrangian of the form
                                         L ∼ (Fµν F µν )2 + . . . ,
where Fµν is the electromagnetic field strength. The higher-order self-interactions (Fµν F µν )2 allow for
stable or metastable solitonic solutions that can connect distant boundary conditions [4].
7.2    “Foresight” Quanta
In the context of cybernetic or cognitive control, one can interpret the amplitude passing through these
wormholes as carrying information about future boundary conditions or neural signals, hence the term
“foresight quanta.” This speculation aligns with the ghost–field formalism in which gauge flux can shape
future configurations of the system.
8     Neural Interfacing with Quantum Scars
8.1    EEG Feedback and Hamiltonian Modulation
A typical real-time neural interface measures multi-channel EEG, preprocesses or filters it into a scalar
control signal                                                  
                                     Γ(t) = M φEEG (t), AEEG (t) ,
where M (·) is some encoding or mapping function, φEEG is an extracted phase from the EEG, and AEEG
is amplitude or power in certain bands. Γ(t) then modulates the system Hamiltonian:
                                           H(t) = H0 + Γ(t) V,
or in Trotterized form,
                                   U (t, t + ∆t) ≈ e−iH0 ∆t e−i Γ(t) V ∆t .
8.2    Scar-Overlap Criterion and Visual Feedback
Real-time estimation of the scar-overlap
                                         Λscar = |⟨Φscar | Ψ(t)⟩|2
                                                      4
provides a numerical measure of how close the wavefunction Ψ(t) is to the desired scar manifold Φscar . This
overlap can be fed back visually or haptically to the user, who then adjusts cognitive states (consciously
or subconsciously) to reinforce or diminish certain scar connections. This closes a brain–machine feedback
loop, allowing the user to direct quantum amplitude flows through mental states [1, 2, 3].

9.1    Synchronizing Neural EEG with a Trotterized Artificial Quantum SCAR
This work [1] details the real-time BCI (brain–computer interface) loop, including:
    • EEG preprocessing and extraction of relevant phases/frequencies,
    • Mapping of EEG features to a time-dependent Hamiltonian term Γ(t)V ,
    • Trotter decomposition strategies for short–time evolution,
    • Visual or auditory feedback indicating the scar-overlap Λscar in near real time.
Mathematical proofs address the local stability of scar states under moderate decoherence and the pos-
sibility of sustained nonthermal occupancy via feedback.
9.2    Mind Warp Foundations & GhostMindWarp
References [6, 5] develop the BRST approach and ghost fields for anomaly cancellation in neural–quantum
contexts. They introduce the concept of brain-generated gauge warp protocols, clarifying how mental
processes can modulate gauge flux and thus reconfigure the Hilbert–space topology.
9.3    The Future Internet Collides With Now
Reference [4] proposes the hyperstructure
                       Mh                                          i
              FI(t) =       HQScar (t) ⊗ HCWA (t) ⊗ Hhypercomputing ⊗ Qneuro−EM (Aµ , t),
                         i
encompassing quantum-scar wormhole attractors, nonlinear EM wormholes, hypercomputation frame-
works, and a recursive Schelling calculus for emergent decision–making. It envisions a large–scale,
real–time network of scar synchronization among diverse physical and cognitive domains.
9.4    ExoticTravel – Neural Quantum Scars and Scar Wormholes
Works [2, 3] examine the role of time-varying boundary conditions in generating or stabilizing scar states
(Neural Quantum Scars). They also analyze nonlinear Schrödinger equations with gauge fields and
boundary operators B[Ψ, ∇Ψ] that yield topological invariants and stable amplitude channels (worm-
holes).
10      Conclusion and Outlook
Summary. We have presented an integrated BRST-anchored framework for controlling quantum scar
states via neural feedback. Key components include:
    • Scar-Link: Coherent channels for amplitude exchange between scar eigenstates,
    • Scar-Field: A global sum of scar projectors forming attractor basins in Hilbert space,
                                                     5
   • Ghost Fields: Essential for gauge redundancy removal and topological reconfiguration,
   • Cybernetic Wormhole Attractors (CWAs): Feedback loops coupling boundary manifolds
     (neural or physical) to scar states and unitaries,
   • Informational Wormholes: Nonlinear QED conduits for amplitude or “foresight” quanta,
   • Neural Interfacing: EEG feedback shaping Γ(t), bridging cognitive states with quantum scar
     dynamics.
Implications. This framework suggests a route to hybrid quantum–neural architectures that exploit
scarring to maintain robust, localized states within high-dimensional Hilbert spaces. By coupling the hu-
man brain or adaptive control algorithms to these states, we can implement selective amplitude transport
between multiple quantum attractors. In principle, one might harness such a system for advanced signal
processing, robust quantum memory, or exotic hypercomputational tasks that draw on gauge freedoms.
Future Directions. Outstanding challenges include:
  1. Experimental Feasibility: Realizing scars in physically accessible systems (e.g. ultracold atoms,
     photonic lattices) and coupling them to real–time EEG signals.
  2. Ghost Flux Stability: Ensuring that ghost warp/drive fields remain BRST-consistent while
     sustaining stable wormholes.
  3. Decoherence and Noise Tolerance: Quantifying how environmental noise affects scar–overlap
     and wormhole longevity in practice.
  4. Scaling Laws: Determining how the control overhead and gauge flux demands grow with system
     size or complexity.
  5. Neuroscience Integration: Deeper investigations into how cognitive processes might modulate
     or sense the scar–field topology in a closed–loop setting.
    While the concepts presented here remain speculative and mathematically idealized, they open an
intriguing landscape for research at the interface of quantum physics, gauge theories, and real–time
brain–machine control.
