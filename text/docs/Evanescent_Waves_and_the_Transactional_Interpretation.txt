Evanescent Waves and the Transactional Interpretation
In the Transactional Interpretation (TI) of quantum mechanics, a quantum event is mediated by
ahandshake between a retarded offer wave, ψoff (x, t), and an advanced confirmation wave, ψconf (x, t).
Evanescent solutions, satisfying
                                                       p
                                 ψ(x) ∼ e−κx ,   κ = 2m(V − E)/ℏ,                                  (1)
appear in classically forbidden regions (e.g. tunneling). Under TI, such evanescent amplitudes represent
nonlocal offer/confirmation waves that decay exponentially in |x| but still contribute to the standing
wave Ψ(x, t) = ψoff + ψconf which enforces conservation across spacetime boundaries.
Vector Potentials and Gauge Fields
The fundamental mediator in QED is the four-potential Aµ = (ϕ, A), governed by the action
                                   Z
                               1
                         S=−         Fµν F µν d4 x, Fµν = ∂µ Aν − ∂ν Aµ .                            (2)
                              4µ0
The Aharonov–Bohm effect demonstrates the physical reality of Aµ even when F µν = 0 locally. Within
TI, Aµ carries the quantum phase information of offer/confirmation waves; gauge invariance,
                                             Aµ → Aµ + ∂µ Λ,                                         (3)
maps families of transactions into equivalent classes without altering empirical outcomes.
  Non-Abelian generalizations, Aaµ with field strength
                                    a
                                   Fµν = ∂µ Aaν − ∂ν Aaµ + gf abc Abµ Acν ,                          (4)
mediate strong and weak interactions, extending the handshake metaphor to SU(N ) charges.
Ghost Fields and BRST Cohomology
Gauge fixing in the path integral requires introduction of Faddeev–Popov ghost fields ca , c̄a , governed
by                             Z
                       Sghost = c̄a −∂ µ Dµb a
                                                b 4       a
                                                c d x , Dµb  = ∂µ δba + gf ac b Acµ .                 (5)
The anti-commuting scalars ca cancel unphysical polarizations in loop diagrams, ensuring unitarity.
Ghosts never appear as external states, analogous to TI confirmation waves which are not directly
observed but enforce consistency.
   In BRST quantization, physical states |Φ⟩ satisfy
                                   QBRST |Φ⟩ = 0,      |Φ⟩ =
                                                           ̸ QBRST |χ⟩,                              (6)
structuring the Hilbert space via cohomology. TI’s transaction boundary conditions likewise project
out nonphysical solutions.
Conceptual Synthesis
   • Evanescent waves implement off /on –shell offer/confirmation amplitudes across classically forbid-
     den zones.
   • Vector potentials Aµ are the primary carriers of quantum phase in both QED and TI, beyond
     local fields.
                                                      1
   • Gauge fields generalize the transactional handshake to non-Abelian charges, preserving local sym-
     metry.
   • Ghost fields play the formal role of enforcing gauge consistency, analogous to TI’s absorber waves
     which maintain conservation without direct detection.
    These elements together suggest a unified view: quantum processes arise from boundary-conditioned
fields— established via advanced and retarded solutions, gauge redundancy, and auxiliary ghost degrees
of freedom— which collectively form the standing-wave transactions observed as particle interactions.
