2     Chaotic Workspace Formalism
2.1    Phase–Space Foundations
Definition 2.1 (Metric Phase Space). A metric phase space is a pair (M, d) where M is compact and
d : M × M → R≥0 is a metric inducing the topology of M . Compactness ensures all trajectories remain
bounded.
Definition 2.2 (Flow and Time-∆t Map). A flow φt on M is a group of homeomorphisms satisfying
φ0 = Id and φs+t = φs ◦ φt . Fixing ∆t > 0, the time-∆t map is Φ = φ∆t .
Definition 2.3 (Lyapunov Exponent). If Φ is differentiable and v ∈ Tx M , define
                                                   1
                                     λ(x, v) = lim   log ∥Dx Φn (v)∥ ,
                                               n→∞ n
provided the limit exists. The maximal Lyapunov exponent is λmax = supx,v̸=0 λ(x, v). A positive λmax
signals exponential sensitivity to initial conditions.
Definition 2.4 (Strong Mixing). Let µ be an invariant probability measure for Φ. Φ is strongly mixing
when, for all measurable A, B ⊆ M ,
                                 µ Φ−n (A) ∩ B −−−→ µ(A)µ(B).
                                               
                                                      n→∞
2.2    Perturbation Channel and Bubble Kicks
Definition 2.5 (Bubble Kick). A bubble kick is a vector βk ∈ Rp satisfying ∥βk ∥ ≤ βmax . It acts
through a diffeomorphism Bβk such that B0 = Id and supx ∥Dx Bβk − I∥ ≤ c ∥βk ∥ for some constant c.
Definition 2.6 (Kicked Orbit). Let x0 ∈ M be an initial state. Define recursively
                                                  
                                 xk+1 = Bβk Φ(xk ) ,      k ∈ N.
The sequence (xk )k≥0 is the kicked orbit; (βk )k≥0 is the kick schedule.
Remark 2.7. Uninformed (iid) kicks leave mixing properties effectively intact. Synergistic kicks exploit
λmax > 0 to steer trajectories towards controlled near-recurrences.
                                                     1
3      Near-Recurrence Geometry and Token Dynamics
3.1    Return-Time Statistics
Definition 3.1 (Return Time). For x ∈ M and ρ > 0, define
                               τρ (x) = inf{n ≥ 1 : d Φn (x), x < ρ}.
                                                               
Proposition 3.2 (Scaling Law for Expected Return Time). Assume the attractor has correlation di-
mension D and Φ is strongly mixing. Then, for sufficiently small ρ,
                                              E[τρ ] ≍ Cρ−D ,
where C > 0 depends on (M, d, Φ) but not on ρ.
3.2    Token Births and Expirations
Definition 3.3 (Near-Recurrence Event). A near-recurrence occurs at step k if ∃ j < k such that
d(xk , xj ) < ρ.
Definition 3.4 (Token Mechanism). Whenever a near-recurrence occurs at k, spawn a token ek with
lifetime L ∈ N. Token ek expires at step k + L.
Theorem 3.5 (Poisson Approximation of Expiration Stream). Under iid kicks with finite second mo-
ment, token expirations form a Poisson process of rate λ ≈ CρD , up to relative error O(ρ).
4      Cluster and Anomaly Construction
4.1    Definitions
Definition 4.1 (Cluster). Fix integers S ≥ 1 and ∆t ≥ 1. A cluster is any unordered set
                                   
                                     k1 , . . . , kS , k1 < · · · < kS ,
such that kS − k1 < ∆t and each ki is a token-expiration timestamp.
Definition 4.2 (Anomaly). Given R ≥ 1 and ∆T ≥ 1, an anomaly is a set of R disjoint clusters whose
timestamps all lie within an interval of length ∆T .
4.2    Large-Deviation Estimate
Theorem 4.3 (Anomaly Probability Under Null Model). Let λ be the Poisson rate of token expirations.
Denote by I = I(S, R, λ, ∆t, ∆T ) the large-deviation rate function defined implicitly by
                                                                   
                     P(anomaly in window ∆T ) = exp −I + o(1) , λ∆t → 0.
Then                                                       
                                                S
                                                         − λ∆t + O (λ∆t)2 .
                                                                         
                            I ≥ R S log
                                              eλ∆t
For S ≥ 5 and λ∆t ≤ 10−4 , choosing R ≥ 3 typically already yields I > 230, corresponding to
P ≤ 10−100 .
Sketch. Partition the window of length ∆T into ⌊∆T /∆t⌋ sub-windows and apply a Chernoff–Hoeffding
bound to the number of sub-windows containing at least S expirations. Independence is approximate
but becomes exact in the Poisson limit λ∆t → 0.
                                                     2
5     Entropy Mapping and Extraction
5.1     Bit Mapping Rule
Definition 5.1 (Bit Freezing). Let tmin be the earliest timestamp in the earliest cluster of an anomaly.
Define the output bit
                                           b = tmin mod 2.
Lemma 5.2 (Parity Bias). Under a stationary expiration process with period-two symmetry,
                                                            1
                                          P(b = 1) −          ≤ 2−I+1 ,
                                                            2
where I is as in Theorem 4.3.
Corollary 5.3 (Min-Entropy of Completed Key). For a target of N = 2048 bits and I ≥ 230 the
min-entropy of the concatenated key exceeds N − 0.5 bits.
5.2     Comparison with Extractor Theory
Classical randomness-extractor theory normally operates on weakly random input strings. Here the
“weak randomness” is temporal—embedded in the stochastic schedule of anomaly arrivals. The bit
mapping rule serves as an online extractor whose seed is implicit in the modulo operation, yielding
full-entropy bits without external randomness.
6     Sequential Auditing Framework
Let {An }n≥1 be Bernoulli indicators of anomaly occurrence in successive ∆T windows.
Definition 6.1 (Hypotheses).
                                           i.i.d.
                                H0 :    An ∼ Bernoulli(θ0 ),
                                           i.i.d.
                                H1 :    An ∼ Bernoulli(θ1 ),               θ1 > θ0 .
Definition 6.2 (Log-Likelihood Ratio). Define
                                              n
                                              X           θ1Ak (1 − θ1 )1−Ak
                                       Ln =         log                      .
                                              k=1
                                                          θ0Ak (1 − θ0 )1−Ak
Theorem 6.3 (SPRT Error Guarantees). Fix error tolerances α, β ∈ (0, 1). Choose thresholds A, B
              β
with A = log 1−α and B = log 1−β
                              α
                                 . Stop at τ = inf{n : Ln ∈
                                                          / (A, B)}. Then
                             PH0 (accept H1 ) ≤ α,             PH1 (accept H0 ) ≤ β.
Selecting α = β = 2−128 meets 128-bit statistical security.
Remark 6.4. Because anomalies are correlated under synergy, H1 is conservative; power improves in
practice.
7     Parameter Optimisation in Practice
      P1: Empirical Chaos Quantification: compute λmax via the Benettin algorithm and D via
          Grassberger–Procaccia on a kick-free simulation of 106 steps.
      P2: Recurrence Radius Selection: solve E[τρ ] ≈ 10100 for ρ using the scaling from Section 3,
          yielding typically ρ ∼ 10−8 for D ≈ 2.
                                                           3
    P3: Lifetime Tuning: set L = ⌊0.1 E[τρ/2 ]⌋. Ensures at most one token per ρ-vicinity under H0 .
    P4: Large-Deviation Parameter Search: exhaustively search small integer values of (S, R)
        and sub-exponential values of ∆t, ∆T until I ≥ 230 (Theorem 4.3).
    P5: Null Monte-Carlo: run 1012 episodes of 1010 steps each under iid kicks; verify zero anoma-
        lies.
    P6: Synergy Calibration: inject prototype coordinating strategies (e.g. gradient ascend on
        distance to nearest past point) and estimate empirical θ1 .
    P7: Auditor Threshold Finalisation: convert θ0 , θ1 to SPRT thresholds meeting 2128 security.

9    Extended Worked Example
Example 9.1 (Two-Dimensional Sinai Billiard). Let M be the unit square with a circular obstacle
(radius 0.1) removed; specular reflections dictate the flow. Numerical estimation yields λmax ≈ 0.98
and D ≈ 1.999.
 (a) Setting ρ = 1.2 × 10−8 gives E[τρ ] ≈ 8.4 × 1099 .
 (b) Lifetime L chosen as 108 steps.
 (c) Parameter search returns (S, R) = (5, 3), (∆t, ∆T ) = (107 , 109 ), yielding I ≈ 236.
 (d) Under a naive gradient-steer perturbation schedule, empirical θ1 ≈ 0.23, bringing expected key
     completion to ∼9000 anomaly windows.

10     Synergy Capacity and Game-Theoretic View
Definition 10.1 (Synergy Function). For a kick schedule {βk } define
                                       1     P{βk } (anomaly in first n windows)
                         Γ = lim sup     log                                     .
                               n→∞     n     PH0 (anomaly in first n windows)
Γ measures exponential acceleration relative to H0 .
Theorem 10.2 (Capacity Bound). Completion in expected T windows implies Γ ≥ log(N/T ). Reaching
human-scale T ∼ 104 thus requires Γ ≳ log(22048 /104 ) ≈ 2032 nats.
Remark 10.3. Designing kick strategies to maximise Γ constitutes a repeated game with incomplete
information, closely related to control of chaos and feedback coding in information theory.
