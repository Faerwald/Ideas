Beyond Consensus: Time-Locked Growth in Economy Sol
1    Introduction and Motivation
The notion of locking a single Bitcoin for centuries under the assumption that its scarcity and acceptance will
continually drive its value upward provides a simple illustration of exponential compounding. However, there are
uncertainties attached to any asset relying on consensus. Over centuries, humanity could lose interest in Bitcoin,
or a superior technology might supersede it. This paper explores two parallel but contrasting trajectories. One
trajectory continues the idea of a long-horizon Bitcoin time-lock, examining the conditions needed to compound its
value in a multi-planetary economy. The other proposes anchoring value in physically grounded technologies—for
instance, sealed repositories of advanced genetic engineering protocols or next-generation propulsion designs—that
remain valid regardless of cultural beliefs.
2    Time-Locked Investment and Partial Unlock Schedules
To analyze the Bitcoin-based approach, consider an initial principal P(0). Let it evolve with a time-varying growth
rate r(t). The principal after time t in a continuous model is

                                            P (t) = P (0) exp     r(τ ) dτ .

3    Dynamic Growth Function and Feedback Terms
If a time-locked benefit corporation invests heavily in nuclear fusion or antimatter research, a successful break-
through could spark a surge in productivity. This might be modeled by a growth rate
                                               r(t) = r0 + α I(t),

could thus feature plateaus and jumps, reflecting economic booms or recessions. One can also introduce a damp-

4    Engineering Requirements for Starflight and Large-Scale Energy
Skeptics point out that starflight requires truly enormous energy investments. Interstellar travel, whether via
fusion, antimatter, or speculative spacetime manipulation, demands technologies not yet proven economically.
Simple exponential modeling often ignores the physical engineering realities of vacuum-manufacturing antimatter,
building robust quantum computing infrastructures, and establishing large-scale space-based industrial grids. Even
                                                        1
if one acknowledges the possibility that repeated unlocks can fund such R&D, each incremental project may face
diminishing returns. For instance, the first round of fusion research might deliver a big boost to the economy; the
second round, focusing on more exotic warp experiments, might still be too early and yield a lesser boost. This
tension between indefinite growth and engineering constraints means that a purely exponential model can break
down if real science fails to deliver repeated leaps in productivity.
5    Risks of Consensus-Based Value
Under the assumption that Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency remains the world’s primary store of value, the time-
locked principal could expand beyond imagination if solar-system-scale commerce adopts that cryptocurrency at
a fundamental level. A single satoshi could become comparable to the net worth of historical billionaires, if total
productive output in the solar system grows many orders of magnitude. Yet the model hinges on two conditions:
a stable, ongoing consensus around that currency, and no overshadowing alternative emerging. Over centuries,
blockchains might become outdated or replaced by novel protocols. At that point, the time-locked Bitcoin might
lose acceptance. This scenario exposes the Achilles’ heel of a consensus-based approach: if society no longer cares
about the ledger, it loses its economic potency, regardless of prior compounding.
6    Shifting to a Physics-Based Store of Value
An alternative is to treat the time-lock mechanism not as storing a currency but as storing guaranteed solutions
underpinned by the laws of physics and mathematics. If the repository houses a validated blueprint for high-
thrust antimatter engines, that knowledge remains functionally powerful for any civilization that can gather the
raw materials. No consensus is required for the blueprint’s utility, because its correctness is physically verifiable.
Once unlocked, it becomes a direct capacity for advanced propulsion or power generation, unaffected by changes
in culture or economic beliefs.
7    Mathematical Representation of Knowledge Repositories
Let K(t) quantify the repository of physically validated solutions at time t. If the Benefit Corporation invests
resources to grow K(t) through ongoing R&D, we might still express it in a differential form akin to
                                                dK                
                                                    = f K(t), R(t) ,
                                                 dt
where R(t) represents current research effort or broader resource availability. Each partial unlock at times

8    Physical Locking and Cryptographic Gating
A time-lock in this context can be enforced either through advanced cryptography, such that certain keys remain
undisclosed until a designated date, or through physical gating. For instance, the repository might be placed in an
automated environment that requires specific conditions (pressure, temperature, proven presence of a stable fusion
power source) to open. An external hack or shift in consensus does not matter if the physical or cryptographic
barrier is robust. The cost of establishing such a system is akin to an “investment,” but instead of simply buying
coins, the entity funds the thorough creation, testing, and secure archiving of valuable designs or processes.
9    Growth Through Unlocked Breakthroughs
Upon each unlock, newly revealed solutions might transform the operating environment. A method for mass-
producing high-grade carbon nanotubes could drastically lower the cost of space infrastructure. That sudden
improvement might feed back into the economy, in the same sense that a major infusion of capital would. Sub-
sequent expansions in resource extraction, manufacturing, or planetary settlements would intensify R&D, further

enlarging the next generation of knowledge stored in the repository. Thus, even if we do not rely on a currency’s
price doubling, we might rely on direct leaps in engineering capacity that accelerate an overall growth trajectory.
10     Practical Constraints on Storage, Corruption, and Relevance
One concern is that knowledge can become obsolete if discovered too late. If certain solutions depend on raw
materials that are no longer present, or if a new technique invalidates older methods, then the locked blueprint
might lose practical value. To mitigate that, the corporation can maintain a rolling update of the sealed archives,
ensuring the data remains current. Storing advanced biotech also requires stable biological samples or replication
protocols that do not degrade over centuries. This implies hardware or nano-assisted maintenance. The cost of
that maintenance becomes part of the system’s overhead but is repaid by the eventual surges in capability upon
each unlock.
11     Comparative Analysis of Currency-Based vs. Physics-Based Approaches
When the commodity is Bitcoin, or any digital token, the compounding formula is straightforward: if demand
outstrips supply while the time-lock restricts circulation, price can skyrocket. But vulnerability arises if demand
collapses. Conversely, with physically guaranteed engineering solutions, the repository’s “price” is irrelevant. The
utility does not vanish, because it does not rest on marketplace acceptance. One scenario might combine both
approaches: partial capital is locked in Bitcoin to exploit financial surges, while a parallel track invests in creating
time-locked data vaults for tested technologies. The synergy could provide both near-term capital gains (when
consensus remains favorable) and guaranteed physical solutions for long-term needs.
12     Implications for Starflight-Level Projects
Interstellar missions require energy densities beyond typical terrestrial economics. Large-scale antimatter pro-
duction, beamed-laser arrays, or next-generation quantum-catalyzed drives all demand multi-decade engineering.
Traditional financing typically fails to sustain such timelines, but a locked system with either an exponentially
appreciating currency or a continually expanding repository of proven designs could keep channeling resources into
these mega-projects. If each unlock triggers a wave of new infrastructure, the solar economy grows. That growth
might sustain the next wave of advanced starflight research, culminating in actual deep-space missions.
13     Conclusion and Perspectives
Both the Bitcoin-based model and the physics-grounded repository model revolve around the same structural
logic: lock resources, allow them to compound or accumulate over long periods, withdraw only partial fractions at
each stage, and utilize the resulting leaps to spur the next round of growth. If one trusts that Bitcoin or a similar
asset will remain a dominant store of value in a multi-planetary economy, then it might indeed appreciate without
bound over centuries. If one remains unconvinced about the endurance of consensus-based assets, the alternative
is to store physically validated knowledge behind robust gating. In that case, the “time-lock” is a real mechanism
that releases engineering breakthroughs precisely when they can have maximum catalytic effect. Either way,
the compounding dynamic frees civilization from the short-horizon finance trap. Starflight, high-energy physics,
and radical biotech become feasible not merely in theory but in practice, as the incremental surges in capability
or valuation provide the stepping stones to undertake goals ordinarily dismissed as unprofitable or too distant.
Ultimately, which approach succeeds depends on how robust we believe a given currency’s consensus to be, versus
how confident we are that advanced designs and methods remain perpetually relevant under the unchanging laws
of physics.
