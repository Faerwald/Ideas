Temporal Scaling via Epoch-Level Feedback in Bitcoin and QED

1. Risk-Light Speed-Up in Bitcoin via Epoch-Level Cooperation
This section formalizes and expands the idea that Bitcoin’s mining schedule—nominally designed to take
roughly 131–140 years to complete—can, under conditions of intelligent global cooperation between miners,
be shortened by a few years without violating any protocol rules. The cooperation occurs not at the level
of individual blocks, but across the difficulty adjustment epochs and halving cycles. The concept hinges on
epoch-level timing dynamics, particularly the 2-week retargeting window and the 4-year halving cycle.
1.1 Canonical Time Constants
Bitcoin defines the following structural constants:
               B = 2016                                          (blocks per difficulty epoch)
              Tb = 600 seconds                                   (target block time)
              T⋆ = B · Tb = 1 209 600 s = 14 days                (target wall-clock duration per epoch)
              H = 210 000                                        (blocks per halving)
                  H
              E=     = 104.166 . . .                             (difficulty epochs per halving)
                  B
              N = 32                                             (total scheduled halvings)
              (0)
            Thalf = E · T⋆ ≈ 4 years                             (nominal halving duration)
             (0)          (0)
           Ttotal = N · Thalf ≈ 131 years                        (total emission timeline)
1.2 Feedback via Difficulty Adjustment
Bitcoin’s protocol adjusts difficulty every epoch according to:
                                                                ∆tn
                                               Dn+1 = Dn ·          ,
                                                                T⋆
   where ∆tn is the wall-clock time taken to mine the previous B = 2016 blocks. The new difficulty affects
only the next epoch; any gain in wall-clock speed prior to the adjustment is not undone retroactively.
1.3 Defining the Cooperation Factor
Define a global cooperation factor:
                                                        ∆t
                                                  α≡       < 1,
                                                        T⋆
    which models the case where every epoch is completed slightly faster than the nominal 14-day target. This
factor reflects a persistent, system-wide coordination strategy, not a transient deviation.
1.4 Effects on the Halving and Total Timeline
Because halving occurs every H = 210 000 blocks, the time per halving cycle under cooperation becomes:
                                                          (0)
                                        Thalf (α) = α · Thalf = H · Tb · α.
   Time saved per halving:
                                                                    (0)
                                            ∆Thalf = (1 − α) · Thalf .
   Total time until the final satoshi under constant α becomes:
                                                                 (0)
                                              Ttotal (α) = α · Ttotal .
                                                         1
Example:
Assume α = 0.9914, corresponding to 13.88 days per epoch (rather than 14 days). Then:
                                ∆Thalf = (1 − 0.9914) · 4 = 0.0343 yr = 12.5 days
                               ∆Ttotal = (1 − 0.9914) · 131 ≈ 1.1 years
   Hence the entire emission schedule finishes in 2138.9 rather than 2140.
                                  α     Epoch Duration (days)       ∆Ttotal (years)
                               0.9914          13.88                     1.1
                               0.9850          13.79                     2.0
                               0.9750          13.65                     3.3
1.5 Why and How This Works
  1. Front-loaded wall-clock gain: Each epoch finished slightly early creates a permanent advancement of
     the block height before the difficulty rises.
  2. Retargeting is local in time: Difficulty adjusts only forward, never backward—there is no retroactive
     correction.
  3. Cooperation is “risk-light”: Staying close to α ≈ 0.99 keeps the system far from dangerous orphan
     rates or violating the 4×/¼× difficulty cap per BIP-9 rules.
  4. Strategic coordination is game-theoretically plausible: If large pools adopt this behavior, they
     gain timeline advantage without direct reward loss, and individual defectors can’t break the effect alone.
   Thus, intelligent coordination at the level of the 2-week epochs, over the entire network, enables a subtle but
measurable shortening of the 131–140 year mining span, possibly finishing 1–3 years earlier without breaking
any consensus rule.
2. Running of the Fine-Structure Constant and Its Analogy
This second idea, inspired by the first, draws a formal and conceptual analogy between the epoch-level feedback
in Bitcoin and the renormalization group behavior of coupling constants in quantum field theory. In particular,
the fine-structure constant α in QED is not constant: it runs with scale due to quantum corrections.
2.1 Running of the Coupling in QED
In QED, the effective electromagnetic coupling at scale Q2 is:
                                                             α0
                                              α(Q2 ) =              ,
                                                         1 − Π(Q2 )
   where Π(Q2 ) arises from vacuum polarization. To leading order:
                                                                  !
                                               α              Q 2
                                                 0
                                                   X
                                     Π(Q2 ) ≈         Q2f ln        ,
                                               3π             m2f
                                                         f
   where the sum runs over all fermion species f with mass mf and charge Qf .
   As energy increases, more virtual pairs become available to polarize the vacuum. Hence the effective
coupling increases with Q2 .
                                                         2
2.2 Beta Function and Renormalization Group Flow
The renormalization group beta function for QED is:
                                                                
                                                dα      2 X
                                      β(α) =         =       Q2f  α2 .
                                             d ln Q2   3π
                                                                f
   Integrating this gives the same logarithmic growth found via loop summation.
   Measured values:
                                               α−1 (me ) ≈ 137.036
                                              α−1 (MZ ) ≈ 127
2.3 Conceptual Structure of the Analogy

 Beta function governs running                      Retarget formula governs feedback
 More virtual particles ⇒ faster running            Higher hash-rate ⇒ faster epoch completion
2.4 Why the Comparison is Valid and Useful
  1. Lagged feedback: In both systems, the value measured at a given time reflects a history of underlying
     activity—loop fluctuations in QED and mining activity in Bitcoin.
  2. Dimensional transmutation: What appears as a constant becomes dependent on external scale:
     energy Q in QED, wall-clock time in Bitcoin.
  3. Continuous vs. discrete: In QED the running is continuous in ln Q; in Bitcoin, the evolution occurs
     discretely every epoch.
  4. Safe scale drift: Both systems permit small deviations from the nominal constant without destabiliza-
     tion—perturbatively in QED, geometrically in Bitcoin.
2.5 Final Remarks on the Analogy
The realization is that both physical and economic protocol constants can acquire subtle, scale-dependent
modifications when the full structure of feedback is taken into account. In quantum field theory, this arises
from renormalization and loop effects. In Bitcoin, it arises from cooperative timing behavior that is technically
compliant with the consensus rules but strategically exploits the structure of difficulty retargeting. In both
systems, we see the emergence of an effective running quantity from what was naively assumed to be fixed.
Appendix: Detailed Derivations and Explanations
A.1    Bitcoin Emission Compression by Cooperative Epoch Timing
Goal. To determine how a persistent fractional reduction in wall-clock time per difficulty epoch propagates
to shorten the total time until the last satoshi is mined.
Step 1: Epoch Duration Reduction
Each difficulty epoch is designed to last:
                                 T⋆ = 2016 · 600 = 1 209 600 seconds = 14 days.
                                                       3
   Assume miners complete each epoch in a fraction α < 1 of this:
                                                         ∆t = αT⋆ .
Step 2: Halving Duration
Each halving event occurs every H = 210 000 blocks. The number of epochs per halving is:
                                                H   210 000
                                          E=      =         ≈ 104.1667.
                                                B    2016
   Nominal halving time:
                                                         (0)
                                                      Thalf = E · T⋆ .
   Under a persistent α, the new halving time becomes:
                                                                             (0)
                                          Thalf (α) = E · (αT⋆ ) = α · Thalf .
   Time saved per halving:
                                                (0)                                (0)
                                  ∆Thalf = Thalf − Thalf (α) = (1 − α) · Thalf .
Step 3: Total Schedule Compression
With N = 32 halvings:
                                    (0)               (0)
                                  Ttotal = N · Thalf ≈ 32 · 4.1 ≈ 131.2 years.
   Then:
                                                   (0)                                   (0)
                              Ttotal (α) = α · Ttotal ,        ∆Ttotal = (1 − α) · Ttotal .
Example:
With α = 0.9914:
                                 ∆Ttotal = (1 − 0.9914) · 131.2 ≈ 1.13 years.
   Thus, final mining completion year shifts from 2140 to approximately 2138.87.
Conclusion. Epoch-level cooperation to consistently finish each 2-week window slightly faster can, over
32 halvings, compound into a multi-year compression of the entire emission schedule. Since the difficulty
algorithm only responds after-the-fact, the cumulative wall-clock advantage cannot be retroactively removed.
This establishes the validity of the risk-light-speed-up strategy.
A.2   Running of the Fine-Structure Constant
Goal. To explain why the electromagnetic coupling constant α increases with energy scale Q2 , and how this
relates to vacuum polarization.
Step 1: Vacuum Polarization Correction
Let the bare coupling be α0 . Due to quantum fluctuations, the vacuum behaves like a dielectric medium,
modifying the effective coupling measured at energy scale Q. The leading-order correction comes from 1-loop
vacuum polarization:
                                                                  !
                                           2    α0 X 2        Q2
                                       Π(Q ) =         Qf ln        ,
                                                3π            m2f
                                                               f
   where Qf is the charge of fermion f , and mf is its mass.
   Then the effective coupling becomes:
                                                               4
                                                              α0
                                               α(Q2 ) =              .
                                                          1 − Π(Q2 )
   This shows α(Q2 ) increases logarithmically with Q2 , because Π(Q2 ) ∼ ln Q2 .
                                                                               
Step 2: Renormalization Group Interpretation
The renormalization group (RG) approach describes the evolution of α under scale transformations:
                                                    dα      2 X 2 2
                                       β(α) ≡          2
                                                         =     Qf α .
                                                 d ln Q    3π
                                                                  f
   This differential equation has the form:
                                              dα     2 X 2
                                                2
                                                  =     Qf d ln Q2 .
                                              α     3π
                                                          f
   Integrating both sides gives the same logarithmic dependence as the loop calculation.
Example: Numerical Change in α−1
At the electron mass scale me , we measure:
                                               α(me )−1 ≈ 137.036.
   At the Z-boson scale MZ ≈ 91.2 GeV, the effective value is:
                                                 α(MZ )−1 ≈ 127.
Conclusion. As more charged fermions become kinematically accessible at higher energy, their virtual loop
contributions reduce vacuum screening, increasing the effective strength of the electromagnetic interaction.
This behavior is rigorously encoded in the renormalization group formalism.
A.3    Structural Parallels and Their Interpretation
   • In both systems, a ”constant” becomes a scale-sensitive variable due to underlying dynamics:
                                                                         ∆t
                                               α(Q2 )     ↔    αBTC =       .
                                                                         T⋆
   • Both exhibit lagged feedback: in QED, from loop integrals; in Bitcoin, from retarget delays.
   • The feedback law in QED is differential (β(α)); in Bitcoin, it is discrete and multiplicative (Dn+1 =
     Dn · ∆t
          T⋆ ).
            n
   • Both systems obey a kind of bounded self-correction that stabilizes the process over time, permitting
     small-scale deviation without collapse.
Meta-Theoretical Insight. The Bitcoin emission system and the fine-structure constant both appear at
first to be fixed constants of nature or protocol. But once one incorporates the full feedback structure—the
blockchain’s epoch retargeting in one case, quantum vacuum fluctuations in the other—these constants are
shown to ”run” with the scale of history or energy, respectively. The mathematical structures governing their
evolution are fundamentally different in form (discrete vs. continuous), but functionally similar: they both
instantiate a shift from fixed constants to dynamic, self-adjusting behaviors across epochs or energy domains.
