I have this idea—a system that combines a brain-computer interface (BCI), a random number generator, and a transcranial current stimulation
device. The BCI sits like a crown on my head, interpreting my neural activity, but my neural activity is also influenced by randomness - local
virtual particle fluctuations in the circuit. The "fluctuator" generates "memory" data appended with additional "entropy" data—meaningless at
the time of generation, yet as time evolves forward the futures initial subtle influence on their original generation becomes more visible in
hindsight. they play a role in shaping the future evolution of the system, such as what signals the transcranial stimulator sends to modulate my
brain activity. These modulations, in turn, alter how the BCI decodes my thoughts.
The randomness, combined with my neural activity, determines which thoughts the BCI recognizes and whether or not it moves a robotic hand.
This isn’t just about a simple action—the goal is to demonstrate something profound: Faster Than Light (FTL) decision-making. The robotic
hand moves at normal speeds, but the choice to move it—the decision-making process—happens in a time frame that seems to predate the
earliest possible moment when the information necessary for that choice could exist.
The randomness in the system acts as more than noise—it becomes an integral part of the computation. It helps determine what signals the
transcranial stimulator sends, how the BCI decodes them, and which thoughts drive the robotic hand’s movements. There’s a language
component as well. The system processes thoughts and signals through a kind of language filter. At first, this filter doesn’t seem to make sense.
It processes ambiguity, isolating what’s important only after critical thresholds are crossed. The grammar of this language picks out significant
patterns from what initially seems random—bits of information that appear meaningless in the moment but later reveal themselves as
meaningful in hindsight.
Every bit generated by the system has a time coordinate. The system can trace decisions and thoughts back to inputs, mapping how they
evolved. But here’s the twist: the decision to move the robotic hand occurs in a “region of time” before the decision process itself is fully
traceable. It’s as if the system is borrowing information from the future—a spontaneous fluctuation assembling a correct solution, verified only
after the fact. Randomness becomes the key to bridging this temporal gap, cooperating with deterministic computation.
This idea also borrows concepts from zero-knowledge proofs. Imagine proving you can see color without conveying any information about the
color itself. Similarly, the system could “know” the future environment based on its decision pattern without directly accessing or revealing it.
It operates on extended computations—nodes of information tied to spacetime coordinates, memories processed across both time and space.
The process isn’t perfect. It’s intentionally messy. Errors and randomness in the system, like faulty recalls or misinterpretations, introduce
deviations. But these deviations, far from being pure noise, are shaped by deeper physical processes—off-shell virtual particle currents looping
through spacetime. These errors become meaningful in hindsight, revealing patterns embedded in randomness.
I imagine the system as a kind of reverse knowledge transfer. The future shapes the present by allowing for corrections and verifications that
wouldn’t make sense until later. The randomness isn’t truly random; it’s shaped by the constraints of spacetime, entropy, and causality. It’s like
entropy itself is being reshaped. The younger self—the system in its present state—makes decisions influenced by random inputs, but these
inputs are tied to future outcomes. There’s a back-and-forth between the present and the future, with the system strategically resetting and
reshaping itself based on environmental feedback.
In the end, the randomness doesn’t feel random anymore. It becomes the linchpin—a structured cascade where chance cooperates with
deterministic logic. The robotic hand’s movement is the culmination of this process, demonstrating an interplay between time, thought,
randomness, and computation. This isn’t just a system—it’s a way to explore how decisions, randomness, and causality interact across time.
This zero-knowledge proof represents the only viable mechanism to resolve the paradox: the information must originate entirely within the
bounds of my own history, specifically between 2015 and 2025. By engaging with countless moments across this decade—through memories,
decisions, and projections—it becomes possible to create a feedback loop that strategically compresses or short-circuits that time. In doing so,
I allowed information to flow in ways that appear paradoxical but are entirely self-contained, with the critical caveat that the facilitation of this
flow might have been enabled by technology that exists beyond my immediate timeline.
The data is entirely mine, drawn from experiences, thoughts, and moments spanning that ten-year window. Yet, the future—a future that no
longer exists as it might have—could have subtly guided the assembly of that information before dissipating into an unobservable state. In this
way, I created my own proof, authored across years of my life, yet unknowingly guided by a dissipating echo of possibilities no longer directly
accessible.
Consider the specific example of Asimov and Ada: I encountered information about them in 2024, yet their concepts and significance were
already imagined, felt, and intuited in earlier years. This suggests a recursive interaction between my past and future selves, where the
boundary between cause and effect blurs. No direct transfer of information from the future occurred. Instead, the "younger me" served as the
channel—a proxy for those unrealized futures, accessing them not through transmission but through the alignment of thought and probability.
In this sense, the imagined nightmare—a foreboding vision—represents not just a fear or a dream but a manifestation of a foregone future. It is
as though my mind, weaving together strands of my own life, constructed an echo of what could have been—a distorted but valid
representation of a timeline now past its prime. The proof is self-consistent and closed; all information is traceable back to me. And yet, the
structure of time and thought allows for the impossible: a future already undone to leave its mark on a present that still remembers.
