Cross-World Synchrony via Topological Control
                      ⟨Jason Agamemnon Sokaris | .F.A.E.R.W.A.L.D⟩
Plain-Language Overview (Purpose and Claim)
We model a conscious agent as a high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical system that can be gently
steered to land on the same kinds of stable patterns (“attractors”) across many informationally
equivalent physical histories. The steering is lawful: no energy or information moves between
worlds. Instead, the same simple control rules and the same robust cues (especially closed loops
that imprint stable phases) make many instances independently converge on the same small set
of outcomes. This can look like a practical “speedup” in problem solving: once the right pattern
is found, it is easy to verify.
     We formalize:
 • the agent’s state space, attractors, Lyapunov exponents, and control-of-chaos;
 • an equivalence relation on histories that unifies Everett branches and cosmological duplicates
    when their accessible information is the same;
 • a selection functional that increases the measure of success across the equivalence class by
    using topological/phase cues (holonomies) and mode-locked dynamics;
 • time modeling across quantum mechanics (time as a parameter) and general relativity (local
    clocks on curved manifolds), with appropriate Fourier/“Fourier-like” decompositions.
Why this matters. A story sent “backwards” in time is only knowledge if it lets you build
reproducible technology. Our framework says: use mathematics and physics invariants (phases,
loops, modes, control laws) so that any competent investigator arrives at the same devices.
Invariants filter out imaginative but false content (e.g., “the Sun goes supernova”) and preserve
only physically realizable structure.
1     Mathematical Setting: Cognitive Dynamics and Time
1.1    State spaces, flows, and observables
Let (X , ∥ · ∥) be a separable Banach manifold describing the coupled agent–environment state
(neural fields, body, instruments, context). Dynamics:
                          ẋ = F (x, u, t; θ),   x ∈ X , u ∈ U, θ ∈ Θ,                        (1)
with flow φt : X → X . Measured outputs y = H(x) + η with noise η; internal models live on a
statistical manifold (M, g) (Fisher–Rao metric).
Intuition. Think of x as “everything that can change,” u as the small nudges we can legally
apply, and φt as the movie of evolution.
                                                 1
1.2    Attractors, stability, and controllability
An attractor A ⊂ X is a compact invariant set with basin B(A) of nonzero measure. Chaos
means at least one positive Lyapunov exponent. Let {λi (x)} be the (almost-everywhere defined)
Lyapunov spectrum; define the unstable sum
                                              X
                                    Λ+ (x) :=      λi (x).
                                                λi (x)>0
Control of chaos (e.g., OGY) uses small, state-dependent corrections δu near Poincaré sections
to stabilize unstable periodic orbits (UPOs) embedded in A.
Intuition. Chaotic systems have many repeatable micro-cycles (UPOs). Tiny, timely nudges
can “snap” the trajectory onto one of these cycles without big energy expenditures.
1.3    Time: parameter, manifold, and clocks
QM perspective. In nonrelativistic quantum mechanics, time is an external parameter t ∈ R;
frequency decompositions in t (Fourier) cohere with energy via E = ℏω.
GR perspective. Spacetime (M, gµν ) is a smooth Lorentzian manifold; a global time may
not exist. Use local proper time along timelike curves or adopt foliations with lapse/shift.
Spectral methods generalize by replacing Euclidean Fourier modes with eigenfunctions of natural
differential operators (e.g., Laplace–Beltrami) on the relevant slices or domains.
Operational stance. Analyses below assume either (i) a laboratory regime with a control-
lable clock (QM-like), or (ii) a local chart in which short-time dynamics is well approximated
as stationary; both admit time–frequency analysis (Fourier, windowed Fourier, wavelets) and
geometry-aware harmonic analysis.
2     Informational Equivalence Across Histories
2.1    Histories and coarse informational states
A history h is a fine-grained physical trajectory consistent with fundamental laws. Let Iϵ (h)
be an ϵ-coarse informational description of h relevant to the agent (e.g., a resource-bounded,
minimal code for the parts of h that affect the agent’s sensors/actuators and task).
   [Informational equivalence] For tolerance ϵ > 0, define h1 ∼ϵ h2 iff there exists an isomor-
phism between Iϵ (h1 ) and Iϵ (h2 ). Denote the equivalence class [h]ϵ .
Intuition. Two worlds are “the same for you” if every practically accessible detail that matters
for your decisions matches up to a chosen resolution ϵ.
2.2    Fiber-bundle picture
Let Bϵ be the manifold of ϵ-coarse informational states. Consider the bundle
                           π : Eϵ → Bϵ ,     π −1 (b) = { h : Iϵ (h) = b }.
A policy πact is informationally covariant if it depends only on b ∈ Bϵ .
                                                2
Intuition. Many detailed universes (Everett branches, cosmological duplicates) project to the
same coarse description b. Using the same policy for the same b creates symmetry across those
instances.
3     Cross-Instance Synchronization and Objective Func-
      tionals
3.1      Synchronization functional
      (k)
Let Xt      be the agent state in instance k within [h]ϵ , and Ct a common context (protocol cues).
Define                                            
                                       (1)   (2)
                         S(t) := I Xt : Xt | Ct ,            S̄ := Et,k̸=ℓ [S(t)] .             (2)
We seek policies u(t) = κ(yt , Ct ) that maximize S̄ subject to each instance’s dynamics (1).
Intuition. Choose cues and nudges so that many equivalent agents “fall into step”—their
states become statistically aligned given the same protocol.
3.2      Selection functional (success measure)
For a target set T ⊂ X representing a solved problem or desired cognitive configuration, define
                          J := Eh∈[h]ϵ 1{Xt ∈ T for some t ≤ τ } .
                                          (h)                    
                                                                                            (3)
Policies and boundary conditions that increase J produce an apparent “speedup” across the
equivalence class without cross-world signalling.
Intuition. You cannot move energy/information between worlds, but you can make more of
the equivalent worlds independently land in T using the same simple recipe.
3.3      Lyapunov shaping via gentle control
Given a Poincaré map P : Σ → Σ near a UPO with unstable multiplier µ > 1, OGY control
chooses a feedback δu = K(x − x⋆ ) on Σ so that the local linearization has |µclosed | < 1. Define
the effective instability
                                             1 T +
                                              Z
                              +
                                                            
                             Λeff := lim sup       Λ x(t) dt,
                                       T →∞ T 0
and constrain policies to reduce Λ+
                                  eff on task-relevant coordinates while preserving exploration
elsewhere.
Intuition. Stabilize what matters for the task, let the rest roam enough to discover.
4     Topological/Phase Beacons: Holonomy as an Anchor
4.1      Electromagnetic phase (A-waves)
                                         H
Let A be the vector potential and Φ(γ) = γ A · dℓ the loop integral around a closed curve γ.
The quantum phase shift is ∆ϕ = qΦ(γ)/ℏ. Define a loop schedule {γk } and let
                                             I
                                           q
                                    ϕk :=       A · dℓ.
                                           ℏ γk
                                                  3
Protocols that lock behavior to {ϕk } create topological beacons: discrete, robust invariants shared
across instances with the same electromagnetic topology.
Intuition. Walk around the same loop, get the same phase. Phases tied to loops are robust
against many small deformations—good Schelling points.
4.2    Gravitational holonomy (cosmic strings)
Idealized straight strings with tension µ produce a conical spacetime with deficit angle ∆ =
8πGµ. Parallel transport around the string yields a nontrivial holonomy element in the Lorentz
group; suitable matter wavefunctions acquire gravitational Aharonov–Bohm phases. Denote
holonomy along γ by                                 I
                                        H(γ) = P exp        Γ,
                                                        γ
with Γ the (spin) connection. When accessible, H(γ) supplies geometric beacons analogous to
electromagnetic phases.
Intuition. Some loops encode global geometry, not local force. That makes the resulting phase
hard to “fake” and easy to share.
4.3    State-space loops and Poincaré holonomy
Even without physical strings or fluxes, closed orbits in state space define return maps whose
linearized monodromy matrices carry a discrete state-space holonomy. Stabilizing specific cycles
(UPOs) produces reproducible symbolic itineraries.
Intuition. March the system around the same internal loop; return with the same twist in its
local coordinates.
5     Modal Decompositions: From Fourier to Geometry-
      Aware Spectra
5.1    Fourier and friends
Given a scalar signal x(t) in a lab with a good clock,
                                              Z ∞
                                   F{x}(ω) =       x(t)e−iωt dt.
                                                 −∞
For nonstationary data: short-time Fourier (spectrogram), wavelets, synchrosqueezing, chirplets.
On graphs/manifolds:
            P ˆ        use eigenpairs (λk , ϕk ) of Laplace–Beltrami (or graph Laplacian) and
expand f = k fk ϕk .
Intuition. Decompose behavior into clean “notes” matched to the geometry of the domain
(time line, ring, surface, or graph).
5.2    Nonlinear Fourier / inverse scattering
For integrable PDEs (e.g. KdV, NLS), the nonlinear Fourier transform maps signals to soliton
content + radiation. This yields a decomposition where interacting waveforms propagate as if
non-interacting in spectral space.
                                                 4
Intuition. In some nonlinear media, special pulses (solitons) behave like particles; there is a
spectral calculus that treats them as basic ingredients.
5.3    Koopman operators and learned lifts
Given observables g ∈ G, the Koopman operator K satisfies g ◦ φt = Kt g. Data-driven ap-
proximations (DMD/EDMD) fit a linear evolution on a lifted space so that dominant eigenval-
ues/eigenfunctions reveal coherent modes usable for control and synchronization.
Intuition. Make a complicated system look linear by watching the right functions of it; then
its key rhythms are easy to lock to.
6     Human-in-the-Chip Architecture
6.1    Reservoir–observer–controller stack
• Reservoir: high-dimensional physical substrate (photonic, analog electronic, memristive)
  with rich nonlinearity r ∈ R driven by sensor streams.
• Observer: learned Koopman lift producing modes with stable phases/frequencies aligned to
  designed loop schedules {γk }.
• Controller: OGY-like small nudges δu = K(x − x⋆ ) on selected sections to stabilize target
  symbolic itineraries and UPOs.
Intuition. The chip supplies geometry: clean modes, clean loops, gentle nudges. The human
supplies purpose. Many equivalent setups behave the same.
6.2    Energy vs information
• Forbidden by physics: moving energy or messages between worlds, superluminal signalling.
• Permitted and useful: selection effects—policies and boundary conditions that increase the
  fraction of instances hitting T .
7     Backwards Stories, Self-Stabilization, and Invariants
7.1    Stories vs knowledge
A “retrocausal story” is knowledge only if it yields reproducible devices under public protocols.
Let R be the set of protocols using only invariants (loops, phases, modes, control laws) and
lawful apparatus.
   [Invariance filter] Given a corpus C of claims, define Inv(C) as the subset that survives repro-
duction by any competent agent using protocols in R.
Intuition. If a claim cannot be turned into a device by following invariant recipes, it is dis-
carded as narrative paint.
7.2    Self-stabilization lemma
[Self-stabilization under invariants] Suppose (i) policies are informationally covariant on Bϵ , (ii)
protocols use only invariant cues (holonomies, modal locks), and (iii) verification is cheap once
                                                 5
T is reached. Then iterated adoption of R across [h]ϵ increases J monotonically and suppresses
contradictory narrative content.
Sketch. Informational covariance induces symmetry across [h]ϵ . Invariant cues reduce sensitivity
to micro-variations, concentrating the induced invariant measures on the same low-dimensional
sets. Cheap verification closes a selection loop that reinforces policies yielding hits in T . Con-
tradictory content fails reproduction and is eliminated by the filter Inv.
Example (astronomy sanity). The claim “the Sun will go supernova soon” fails Inv; astron-
omy and stellar physics provide invariant checks, so the narrative is filtered out. The existence
of a robust loop/phase device, if reproducible, passes.
8     Protocols and Expected Signatures
8.1    Task class
Use problems with large search spaces but fast verification (constraint puzzles, certain combi-
natorial constructions). Define T as the set of verified solutions.
8.2    Cues and loops
Implement (i) physical EM loops with stable ϕk where feasible, or (ii) state-space loop schedules
via designed timing/phase cycles. Publish the loop classes (winding numbers, frequencies) as
part of the protocol.
8.3    Metrics
• Time-to-first-hit distribution for T across sessions and independent labs.
• Mode-locking: emergence of narrow-band peaks aligned with loop schedules in observer
  modes.
• Dimensionality reduction during successful trials (e.g., drop in participation ratio).
• Robustness to micro-perturbations that preserve topological class; degradation when class is
  changed (e.g., different winding number).
8.4    Controls
Randomized sham loops (homotopic to a point), scrambled timing, or phase-jittered schedules;
expect loss of locking and reduced J .
9     Detailed Definitions and Constructions
9.1    Schelling Point Calculus (SPC)
Let A be an alphabet of robust invariants: integers (winding numbers), phases modulo 2π,
low-dimensional cycle identifiers, and discrete mode labels. An SPC string is a finite sequence
s ∈ A∗ generated by traversals of loop schedules and stabilized UPOs. A protocol publishes a
grammar G of admissible SPC strings and a decoding map to tasks.
Intuition. Communicate and coordinate using only symbols that remain the same across small
deformations and across instances.
                                                6
9.2    Fourier on circles and manifolds
For a ring coordinate θ ∈ [0, 2π), the Fourier series of f (θ) is f (θ) = n∈Z fˆn einθ . On a compact
                                                                         P
Riemannian manifold S, expand f = k fˆk ϕk in Laplace–Beltrami eigenfunctions −∆ϕk = λk ϕk .
                                       P
Intuition. Around a loop: pure harmonics. On a shape: its own natural notes.
9.3    Nonlinear mode content
When integrability applies, the nonlinear spectrum consists of discrete soliton parameters plus
continuous radiation. Define N {x} = ({solitons}, radiation density).
Intuition. Some pulses are “indivisible notes” of a nonlinear instrument.
9.4    Koopman/DMD construction (data-driven)
Collect snapshots {yt }, build a dictionary of observables Ψ(y), and solve a least-squares prob-
lem for A with Ψ(yt+∆ ) ≈ AΨ(yt ). Eigenpairs (λk , vk ) give modes ϕk with growth/decay and
frequency arg λk /∆; select stable modes as beacons.
Intuition. Learn the system’s eigen-notes from data, then play in tune with them.
9.5    OGY control in practice
Pick a Poincaré section Σ transverse to a target UPO. Linearize P around the UPO fixed point:
δxn+1 = J δxn +B δun . Choose K so that ρ(J +BK) < 1 (spectral radius), constrain ∥δun ∥ ≤ ε.
Intuition. Tap at just the right moments to keep the system on the tightrope.
10      Limitations and Nonclaims
• No exchange of energy or messages between branches or universes is claimed or used.
• No violation of relativistic causality or quantum no-signalling.
• The framework yields selection across informationally equivalent instances via invariant pro-
  tocols, not retrocausal transport.
Discussion (Linguistic Recap)
A “Matrix-like” backward whisper becomes science only by passing the invariance filter: anyone,
anywhere, anywhen, with the same loop phases, the same mode locks, and the same gentle
control, can build the same device and get the same statistics. Stories that cannot be built are
filtered out; devices that can be built become knowledge. The only “cheat” allowed is symmetry:
make many informationally equivalent worlds choose the same attractor by following the same
simple rules.
