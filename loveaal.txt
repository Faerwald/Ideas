Ada Lovelace’s Algorithm for Bernoulli Numbers
Historical Context
Ada Lovelace, often credited as the ﬁrst computer programmer, developed an algorithm to calculate
Bernoulli numbers using Charles Babbage’s Analytical Engine. This early example of an algorithm
demonstrates the foundational ideas in programming and computational mathematics.
Algorithm Overview
Ada Lovelace’s approach to calculating Bernoulli numbers was innovative because it applied a methodical
and recursive process suited to the capabilities of the Analytical Engine. Her work demonstrated the
application of loops and conditional operations, fundamental concepts in computer programming.
Mathematical Foundation
The Bernoulli numbers Bn are a sequence of rational numbers important in number theory, and they
appear in the Taylor series expansions of certain trigonometric functions. They are deﬁned recursively
by:
                                             X n       
                                                   n+1
                             B0 = 1, and                  Bk = 0 for n > 0
                                                      k
                                              k=0
Algorithmic Steps
Ada’s algorithm involved the following steps, structured to be executed by the mechanical operations of
the Analytical Engine:
  1. Initialize the ﬁrst Bernoulli number B0 = 1.
  2. For each subsequent n, calculate Bn using the recursive formula:
                                             X n + 1 
                                            n−1
                                                                 1
                                     Bn = −              Bk
                                                    k       n+1−k
                                               k=0
  3. Store each Bn in the machine’s memory for use in subsequent calculations.
Signiﬁcance and Impact
The method Ada Lovelace devised was signiﬁcant not only for its immediate application but also for
its demonstration of the capabilities of algorithmic logic and mechanical computation. Her work with
Bernoulli numbers exempliﬁed how complex mathematical calculations could be automated, paving the
way for modern computing systems.
Legacy
Ada Lovelace’s contributions to computing are often highlighted by her work on the Bernoulli numbers,
which stands as a testament to her foresight in the potential of computers to go beyond simple calculation
tasks and handle sophisticated, recursive algorithms. This work underscores her legacy as a pioneer in
the ﬁeld of computer science.
