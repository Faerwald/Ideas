Candidate Names
  1. Radionuclide Decay Analyzer (RDA)
  2. Multi-Radionuclide Deconvolution Toolkit (MRDT)
  3. Pair-Slope Half-Life Extractor (PSHLE)
  4. Isotope Cocktail Solver (ICS)
Project summary. The software ingests aggregate radioactive count data from a mixed-isotope sam-
ple, converts random point pairs into slope-based decay estimates, isolates peak half-lives, and refines
amplitudes via bounded nonlinear least-squares. The automated spectrum of radionuclide half-lives and
activities is the proof-of-replication that earns a dedicated three-hour session with my professor—an
essential stepping stone toward publishing the method, recruiting collaborators, and launching the
company’s next phase.
